<h3><i>THE BOOK.</i></h3>

<p>The full title of this book is &#8220;The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the
Christ of the Piscean Age,&#8221; and the critical reader is apt to ask a number
of pertinent questions concerning it. Among the many anticipated questions
these are perhaps the most important:</p>

<blockquote class="nohang">

<p><span class="leadnum">1</span> What is an Age?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> What is the Piscean Age?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> What is the Aquarian Age?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> What are the Akashic Records?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="leadnum">1</span> <i>What is an Age?</i> Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family
of planets revolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles distant,
and that it requires something less than 26,000 years to make one revolution.
His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into twelve signs,
familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. It requires our
Solar System a little more than 2100 years to pass through one of these
signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age or Dispensation. Because
of what Astronomers call &#8220;the precession of the Equinoxes&#8221; the
movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac is in order reverse
from that given above.</p>

<p><i>Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age.</i> Regarding this matter there
is a disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are not
called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for their opinions;
there are enough well authenticated facts for our present purposes.
It is conceded by all critical students that the sun entered the zodiacal
sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when the Taurian Age began;
that Abraham lived not far from the beginning of the Arian Age, when the
sun entered the sign Aries. About the time of the rise of the Roman empire
the sun entered the sign Pisces, the Fishes, and the Piscean Age began,
so that early in this Age Jesus of Nazareth lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">2</span> <i>What is the Piscean Age?</i> This question requires further consideration.
The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian Dispensation.
The word Pisces means fish. The sign is known as a water sign, and the
Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the fish and its element, water.</p>

<p>In the establishment of their great institutions John the Harbinger and
Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been used in
some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults, even to the
present time. Water is the true symbol of purification. Jesus himself
said to the Harbinger before he was baptized: &#8220;All men must be washed,
symbolic of the cleansing of the soul.&#8221; (Aquarian Gospel 64:7.)</p>

<p><i>Fish was a Christian Symbol.</i> In the earlier centuries of the Christian
Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol. In his
remarkable book, &#8220;Christian Iconography,&#8221; Didron says:</p>

<p>&#8220;The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol of
Jesus Christ. The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian monuments,
and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi. It is also upon
medals, bearing the name of our Savior and also upon engraved stones,
cameos and intaglios. The fish is also to be remarked upon the amulets
worn suspended from the necks by children, and upon ancient glasses and
sculptured lamps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish.
The fish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the
table, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at the
banquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: &#8220;We are little
fishes in Christ our great fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly
been one of water and the many uses of that element have been
emphasized, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to a
high degree of efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> <i>What is the Aquarian Age?</i> The human race is today standing upon
the cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the
New Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air,
electricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea, and
send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of lightning.</p>

<p>The word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning
water. Aquarius is, however, the <i>water bearer</i>, and the symbol of the sign,
which is the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his right hand
a pitcher of water. Jesus referred to the beginning of the Aquarian Age
in these words:</p>

<p>&#8220;And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an arc
of heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in the
eastern sky. The wise will then lift up their heads and know that the
redemption of the earth is near.&#8221; (Aquarian Gospel 157:29, 30.)</p>

<p>The Aquarian Age is pre-eminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual
side of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be comprehended
by multitudes of people for the many are now coming into an
advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety this book
is called &#8220;The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<i>An Important Event.</i> The transfer of dominion from one Age to
another is an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim.
Among the manuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper
describing the transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian
Age, but it is difficult to determine whether it is a recital of facts or a prophetic
statement. We reproduce the paper in full.</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="center larger">THE CUSP OF THE AGES.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Spirit I was caught away into
the realms of Akasha; I stood alone
within the circle of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there I found the secret spring
that opens up the door to Wisdom and
an understanding heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I entered in and then I knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the four and twenty Cherubim
and Seraphim that guard the circle of
the sun, the mighty ones who were proclaimed
by masters long ago &#8216;the four
and twenty ancient ones.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the names of every Cherubim
and Seraphim, and learned that
every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by
two&mdash;a Cherubim and Seraphim.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I stood upon the cusp
where Ages meet. The Piscean Age
had passed; the Aquarian Age had just
begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the guardian Spirits of the
Piscean Age; Ramasa is the Cherubim;
Vacabiel is Seraphim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the guardian Spirits of the
Aquarian Age, and Archer is the Cherubim;
Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.</p>

<p>&#8220;These four great spirits of the Triune
God stood close together on the cusp,
and in the presence of the sacred
Three&mdash;the God of Might, the God of
Wisdom, and the God of Love&mdash;the
scepter of Domain, of Might, of Wisdom
and of Love was there transferred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the charges of the Triune
God; but these I may not now reveal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the history of the Piscean
Age from Piscean Cherubim and Seraphim,
and when I took my pen to write
Ramasa said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, my son, not now; but you
may write it down for men when men
have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood,
of Peace on earth, good-will to
every living thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I heard the Aquarian
Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim the
Gospel of the coming Age, the age of
Wisdom, of the Son of Man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when the crown was lifted
from the head of Ramasa and placed
upon the head of Archer of the Aquarian
Age; and when the royal scepter was
transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to
Seraphim Sakmaquil there was deep
silence in the courts of heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then the goddess Wisdom
spoke, and with her hands outstretched
she poured the benedictions of the Holy
Breath upon the rulers of Aquarius.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not write the words she
spoke, but I may tell the Gospel of the
coming age that Archer told when he
received the crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I may breathe to men the song
of praise that Seraphim Sakmaquil sung
when she received the royal scepter of
the newborn age.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Gospel I will tell, and I will
sing this song in every land, to all the
people, tribes and tongues of earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> <i>What is Meant by &#8220;the Christ,&#8221; as the Word is Used in This Book?</i>
The word Christ is derived from the Greek word Kristos and means anointed.
It is identical with the Hebrew word Messiah. The word Christ, per se,
does not refer to any particular person; every anointed person is christed.
When the definite article &#8220;the&#8221; is placed before the word christ a definite
personality is indicated, and this personality is none other than a member
of the Trinity, the Son who had a glory with the Father-Mother before the
worlds were formed.</p>

<p>According to the teachings of all ancient masters this Son is Love; so
the Christ is Love, and Love is God, since God is Love.</p>

<p>Another remarkable manuscript found in Levi&#8217;s Akashic portfolio
gives the clearest possible ideal of the Christ, or Love of God. It is presumed
that this manuscript is a direct transcription from the Akashic
Records and its importance demands its reproduction here in full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="center larger">THE CHRIST</p>

<p>&#8220;Before creation was the Christ
walked with the Father God and Mother
God in Akasha.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Christ is son, the only son begotten
by Almighty God, the God of
Force and God omniscient, God of
thought; and Christ is God, the God of
Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the Christ there was no
light. Through Christ all life was manifest;
and so through him all things were
done, and naught was done in forming
worlds or peopling worlds without the
Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christ is the Logos of Infinities and
through the word alone are Thought and
Force made manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Son is called the Christ, because
the Son, the Love, the universal
Love, was set apart, ordained to be
creator, Lord, preserver and redeemer
of all things, of everything that is, or
evermore will be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through Christ, the protoplast, the
earth, the plant, the beast, the man, the
angel and the cherubim took up their
stations on their planes of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through Christ they are preserved;
and if they fall it is the Christ who lifts
them up; and if they sell themselves to
sin the Christ redeems.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Christ, the universal Love,
pervades all spaces of infinity, and so
there is no end to love.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the great heart of Love unnumbered
spirits were sent forth to
demonstrate the height, the depth, the
width, the boundlessness of Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;To every world and star and moon
and sun a master spirit of this Love
divine was sent; and all were full
anointed with the oil of helpfulness, and
each became a Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;All glorious in his majesty is
Christ, who spread the pure white robe
of Love o&#8217;er all the planes of earth&mdash;The
Christ of earth, its heaven, its
graves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In course of time the protoplast, the
earth, the plant, the beast, the man sold
out their birthrights unto sin; but
Christ was present to redeem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hid in the holiest place in all infinities
is locked the scroll that bears the
record of the purposes of God, the Triune
God, and there we read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfection is the ultimate of life.
A seed is perfect in its embryotic life,
but it is destined to unfold, to grow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the soil of every plane these
seeds, which were the Thoughts of God,
were cast&mdash;the seeds of protoplast, of
earth, of plant, of beast, of man, of
angel and of cherubim, and they who
sowed the seeds, through Christ, ordained
that they should grow, and
should return at last, by effort of unnumbered
years, to the great granary of
thought, and each be a perfection of its
kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;And in the boundless blessedness of
Love the man was made the Lord of
protoplast, of earth, of plant, of beast;
and Christ proclaimed: Man shall
have full dominion over everything that
is upon these planes of life; and it was
so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he who gave the lordship unto
man declared that he must rule by Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;But men grew cruel and they lost
their power to rule, and protoplast, and
earth, and plant and beast became at
enmity with man; he lost his heritage;
but Christ was present to redeem.</p>

<p>&#8220;But man had lost his consciousness
of right; he could no longer comprehend
the boundlessness of Love; he could see
naught but self, and things of self; but
Christ was there to seek the lost and
save.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that he might be close to man in
all the ways of life, that man might
comprehend the mighty spirit of the
Love, the Christ of earth made manifest
to human eyes and ears by taking his
abode in some pure person, well prepared
by many lives to be a fit abiding
place of Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus Christ made manifest Love&#8217;s
power to save; but men forgot so soon,
and so Christ must manifest again, and
then again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ever since man took his place
in form of flesh the Christ has been manifest
in flesh at first of every age.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> <i>What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?</i>
Orthodox Christian ecclesiastics tell us that Jesus of Nazareth and the
Christ were one; that the true name of this remarkable person was Jesus
Christ. They tell us that this man of Galilee was the very eternal God
clothed in flesh of man that men might see his glory. Of course this doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
is wholly at variance with the teachings of Jesus himself and of his
apostles. The Aquarian Masters in council have formulated an answer to
this question that so well covers all the information required that we give
it in full:</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>&#8220;Jesus was an ideal Jew, born in
Bethlehem of Judea. His mother was
a beautiful Jewish girl named Mary.
As a child Jesus differed but little from
other children only that in past lives he
had overcome carnal propensities to
such an extent that he could be tempted
like others and not yield. Paul was
right when to the Hebrews he said:
&#8216;He was in all points tempted like as
we are, yet without sin.&#8217;&mdash;Hebrews
4:15.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus suffered as other men suffer,
and was made perfect through suffering;
for this is the only way to perfection.
His life was an example of attainment
by the way of crosses and cruel treatment.
Paul was right again when he
said: &#8216;It became him, for whom are all
things and by whom are all things, in
bringing many sons into glory to make
the captain of their salvation perfect
through suffering.&#8217;&mdash;Hebrews 2:10.</p>

<p>&#8220;In many respects Jesus was a remarkable
child, for by ages of strenuous
preparation he was qualified to be an
avatar, a savior of the world, and from
childhood he was endowed with superior
wisdom and was conscious of the fact
that he was competent to lead the race
into the higher ways of spiritual living.
But he was conscious also of the fact
that he must attain the mastery by
trials, bufferings, temptations and sufferings.
And all his life was spent in
attaining. After his death, burial and
resurrection he appeared in materialized
form before the Silent Brothers in the
temple of Heliopolis, in Egypt, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My human life was wholly given
to bring my will to tune with the deific
will; when this was done my earth-tasks
all were done.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You know that all my life was one
great drama for the sons of men; a
pattern for the sons of men. I lived to
show the possibilities of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What I have done all men can do,
and what I am all men shall be.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;Aquarian
Gospel 178:43, 46.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus was the name of the man and
it was the only appropriate name for
this kind of a man. The word means
Savior and Jesus was in more senses
than one a savior.</p>

<p>The word Christ means &#8220;the anointed
one,&#8221; and then it is an official
title. It means, The Master of Love.
When we say &#8220;Jesus the Christ&#8221; we
refer to the man and to his office; just as
we do when we say Edward, the King,
or Lincoln, the President. Edward was
not always King, and Lincoln was not
always President, and Jesus was not
always Christ. Jesus won his Christship
by a strenuous life, and in the
Aquarian Gospel, chapter 55, we have a
record of the events of his christing, or
receiving the degree Christ. Here is
where he was coronated by the highest
earth authorities as the Christ-King;
properly speaking, &#8216;The Master of
Love&#8217;; and after this was done he
entered at once upon his Judean and
Galilean ministry.</p>

<p>&#8220;We recognize the facts that Jesus
was man and that Christ was God, so
that in very truth Jesus the Christ was
the God-man of the ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Nazarene&#8217;s Testimony. Jesus
himself made the matter clear. Once
when he was speaking to a congregation
in Bethany the people called him King
and he stood forth and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am not sent to sit upon a throne to
rule as Caesar rules; and you may tell
the ruler of the Jews that I am not a
claimant for his throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Men call me Christ, and God has
recognized the name; but Christ is not a
man. The Christ is universal Love, and
Love is King.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This Jesus is but man who has been
fitted by temptations overcome, by
trials multiform, to be the temple
through which the Christ can manifest
to men.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then hear, you men of Israel, hear!
Look not upon the flesh; it is not king.
Look to the Christ within who shall be
formed in every one of you, as he is
formed in me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When you have purified your hearts
by faith, the king will enter in and you
will see his face.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;Aquarian Gospel
68:10&ndash;14.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Surely this question has been answered. Jesus was man; Christ was
Divine Love&mdash;the Love of God, and after thirty years of strenuous life
the man had made his body fit to be the temple of the holy breath and
Love took full possession, and John well said when he declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> <i>Who was Levi, the Transcriber of this Book?</i> Regarding the personality
of Levi we are permitted to write but little. Suffice it to say that he
is an American citizen, and has been a close student of the religions of the
world from childhood. When but a boy he was impressed with the sensitiveness
of the finer ethers and believed that in some manner they were
sensitized plates on which sounds, even thoughts, were recorded. With
avidity he entered into the deeper studies of etheric vibration, determined
to solve the great mysteries of the heavens for himself. Forty years he spent
in study and silent meditation, and then he found himself in that stage of
spiritual consciousness that permitted him to enter the domain of these
superfine ethers and become familiar with their mysteries. He then
learned that the imaginings of his boyhood days were founded upon veritable
facts, and that every thought of every living thing is there recorded.</p>

<p>In his manuscript entitled &#8220;The Cusp of the Ages,&#8221; a part of which we
have already reproduced in this Introduction, we find the following copy
of the Commission, which Levi received from Visel, the Goddess of Wisdom,
or the Holy Breath.</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="center larger">LEVI&#8217;S COMMISSION.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then Visel the holy one stood
forth and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;O Levi, son of man, behold, for you
are called to be the message bearer of
the coming age&mdash;the age of spirit
blessedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give heed, O son of man, for men
must know the Christ, the Love of God;
for Love is sovereign balm for all the
wounds of men, the remedy for every ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;And man must be endowed with
Wisdom and with Power and with an
Understanding heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold the Akasha! Behold the
Record Galleries of Visel where every
thought and word and deed of every
living thing is written down.</p>

<p>&#8220;The needs of men are manifold,
and men must know their needs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Levi, hearken to my words:
go forth into these mystic Galleries and
read. There you will find a message
for the world; for every man; for every
living thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I breathe upon you now the Holy
Breath; you will discriminate, and you
will know the lessons that these Record
Books of God are keeping now for men
of this new age.</p>

<p>&#8220;This age will be an age of splendor
and of light, because it is the home age
of the Holy Breath; and Holy Breath
will testify anew for Christ, the Logos
of eternal Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first of every age this Logos is
made manifest in flesh so man can see
and know and comprehend a Love that
is not narrow, circumscribed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve times in every revolution of
the sun this christed Love of God is
made full manifest in flesh upon the
planes of earth, and you may read in
Akasha the wondrous lessons that these
Christs have taught to men; but you
shall publish not to men the lessons of
the Christs of ancient times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Levi, message bearer of the
Spirit Age, take up your pen and write.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write full the story of The Christ
who built upon the Solid Rock of yonder
circle of the sun&mdash;the Christ who men
have known as Enoch the Initiate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
&#8220;Write of his works as prophet,
priest and seer; write of his life of purity
and love, and how he changed his carnal
flesh to flesh divine without descending
through the gates of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may write the story of
Melchizedec, the Christ who lived when
Abram lived, and pointed out to men the
way to life through sacrifice; who gave
his life a willing sacrifice for men.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may write the story of the
Prince of Peace, The Christ who came as
babe in Bethlehem, and traveled every
way of life that man must tread.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was despised, rejected and
abused; was spit upon, was crucified,
was buried in a tomb; but he revived
and rose a conqueror over death that he
might show the possibilities of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand times he said to men;
&#8216;I came to show the possibilities of man;
what I have done all men may do, and
what I am all men shall be.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;These stories of The Christ will be
enough, for they contain the true philosophy
of life, of death and of the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;They show the spiral journey of the
soul until the man of earth and God are
one forevermore.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Levi in Prophecy.</i> About two thousand years ago Elihu, who conducted
a school of the prophets in Zoan, Egypt, referred to Levi thus:</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>&#8220;This age will comprehend but little
of the works of Purity and Love; but
not a word is lost, for in the Book of
God&#8217;s Remembrance a registry is made
of every thought and word and deed;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when the world is ready to receive,
lo, God will send a messenger to
open up the book and copy from its
sacred pages all the messages of Purity
and Love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then every man of earth will read
the words of life in the language of his
native land, and men will see the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;And man again will be at one with
God.&#8221;&mdash;Aquarian Gospel 7:25&ndash;28.</p></blockquote>

<p>Further references to the personality of Levi are, seemingly, unnecessary.
It matters but little who he is; his work in the transcription of the
Aquarian Gospel of Jesus, the Christ, stands unimpeachable. The lessons
of this book all bear the stamp of the Nazarene, for no man except the
world&#8217;s greatest master could have touched the high chords of divine Love
and Wisdom which characterize the pages of this marvelous book.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> <i>What are the Akashic Records?</i> Akasha is a Sanskrit word, and
means &#8220;Primary substance,&#8221; that out of which all things are formed.
According to Aquarian philosophy, it is the first stage of the crystallization
of spirit. This philosophy recognizes the fact that all primordial substance
is spirit; that matter is spirit moving at a lower rate of vibration, becoming,
as one master expressed it, a coagulum.</p>

<p>This Akashic, or primary substance, is of exquisite fineness and is so
sensitive that the slightest vibrations of an ether any place in the universe
registers an indelible impression upon it.</p>

<p>This primal substance is not relegated to any particular part of the
universe, but is everywhere present. It is in very fact the &#8220;Universal
Mind&#8221; of which our metaphysicians speak.</p>

<p>When the mind of man is in exact accord with the Universal Mind man
enters into a conscious recognition of these Akashic impressions, and may
collect them and translate them into any language of earth with which he is
familiar.</p>

<p>In the infinite One manifest we note the attributes of Force, Intelligence
and Love, and a person may be in full accord with one of these attributes
and not with the others. One may enter fully into the spirit of the
God of Force and not be imbued with the spirit of Intelligence; or one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
be wholly absorbed with the spirit of Divine Love and be far removed from
both Intelligence and Force. Furthermore, a person may enter fully into
the consciousness of Holy Breath, or Supreme Intelligence, and be not
at all in rapport with either Love or Force. Knowledge is not gained
through the spirit of either Force or Love. It is only from Universal Mind,
which is Supreme Intelligence, called by Oriental scholars the Akashic
Records, and by Hebrew masters, the Book of God&#8217;s Remembrance, that
knowledge of any kind can be obtained.</p>

<blockquote class="nohang">

<p><i>Consciousness</i>; we note three phases of it:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">1</span> Consciousness of the omnipotence of God and man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Christ consciousness, or consciousness of Divine Love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Consciousness of the Holy Breath, or of Supreme Intelligence.</p></blockquote>

<p>We must bear in mind that one of these phases of consciousness does
not necessarily imply either of the others. People are frequently found who
are completely filled with the Love of God, are far advanced in the science
of Christ consciousness, who are absolutely ignorant; have not the slightest
conception of the laws of natural things or of spiritual things; are not in
rapport with the great Teacher which is the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><i>The Akashic Records.</i> The imperishable records of life, known as the
Akashic Records, are wholly in the domain of Supreme Intelligence, or
Universal Mind, and the Akashic Record reader must be in such close touch
with the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Breath, as the ancient masters call this
spirit of Supreme Intelligence, that every thought vibration is instantly felt
in every fibre of his being.</p>

<p><i>Differentiation.</i> Since all space is charged with the vibrations of
thoughts of all kinds how may the Akashic Record reader differentiate and
gather only the thoughts and life events of a particular person or group of
persons?</p>

<p>Every person has his own distinct vibration and when the reader fully
understands the law of discrimination his whole being is tuned for the reception
of the one particular tone and rhythm, and it is impossible for any other
tone or rhythm to make the slightest impression upon him. This principle
is demonstrated in wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>It required many years for Levi to learn the Law of Differentiation,
and to come in rapport with the tones and rhythms of Jesus of Nazareth,
Enoch and Melchizedec and their co-laborers. But under the direction of
the Spirit of Supreme Intelligence, he has attained unto this accomplishment,
and now he instantly feels in all his being the slightest vibrations that
come from any of these great centers and, of course, all of his transcriptions
are true to the letter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Man.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou
visiteth him?&#8221; This was the earnest question of David, the Hebrew
Psalmist, and the 8th Psalm is given wholly to the contemplation of man,
the crowning work of manifest creation. Among the many great lessons
that Levi has been permitted to gather from the Akashic Records, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Universal Mind, we find one on <i>Man</i> in which his descent into physical
matter and his final ascent into an eternal oneness with God is so graphically
described that it certainly merits a place in this Introduction, and we give it
in full:</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>&#8220;Time never was when man was not.</p>

<p>&#8220;If life of man at any time began a
time would come when it would end.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thoughts of God cannot be
circumscribed. No finite mind can
comprehend things infinite.</p>

<p>&#8220;All finite things are subject unto
change. All finite things will cease to
be, because there was a time when they
were not.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bodies and the soul of men are
finite things, and they will change, yea,
from the finite point of view the time
will come when they will be no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;But man himself is not the body,
nor the soul; he is a spirit and is part
of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creative Fiat gave to man, to spirit
man, a soul that he might function on
the plane of soul; gave him a body of the
flesh, that he might function on the
plane of things made manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did creative Fiat give to spirit
man a soul that he might function on the
plane of soul?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did creative Fiat give to soul a
body of the flesh that it might function
on the plane of things that are made
manifest?</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, ye worlds, dominions,
powers and thrones!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, ye cherubim, ye seraphim,
ye angels and ye men!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, O protoplast, and earth,
and plant and beast!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, ye creeping things of
earth, ye fish that swim, ye birds that
fly!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, ye winds that blow, ye
thunders and ye lightnings of the sky!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, ye spirits of the fire, of
water, earth and air!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, now, O everything that is, or
was, or evermore will be, for Wisdom
speaks from out the highest plane of
spirit life:</p>

<p>&#8220;Man is a thought of God; all
thoughts of God are infinite; they are not
measured up by time, for things that are
concerned with time begin and end.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thoughts of God are from the
everlasting of the past unto the never
ending days to come&mdash;And so is man,
the Spirit-man.</p>

<p>&#8220;But man, like every other thought of
God, was but a seed, a seed that held
within itself the potencies of God, just
as the seed of any plant of earth holds
deep within itself the attributes of every
part of that especial plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;So spirit-man, as seed of God, held
deep within himself the attributes of
every part of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, seeds are perfect, yea, as perfect
as the source from which they come;
but they are not unfolded into life made
manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child in utero is perfect as the
mother is.</p>

<p>&#8220;So man, the seed, must be deep
planted in a soil that he might grow, unfold,
as does the bud unfold to show the
flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;The human seed that came forth
from the heart of God was full ordained
to be the lord of plane of soul, and of
the plane of things made manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;So God, the husbandman of every
thing that is, threw forth this human
seed into the soil of soul; it grew apace,
and man became a living soul; and he
became the lord of all the kingdom of
the soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark, now, let every creature hear,
The plane of soul is but the ether of the
spirit plane vibrating not so fast, and in
the slower rhythm of this plane the
essences of life are manifest; the perfumes
and the odors, the true sensations
and the all of love are manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;And these soul attributes become a
body beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;A multitude of lessons man must
learn upon the plane of soul; and here
he tarries many ages until his lessons are
all learned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the boundary of the plane of
soul the ether began to vibrate slower
still, and then the essences took on a
garb; the perfumes and the odors and
the true sensations and the all of love
were clothed in flesh; and man was
clothed in flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfected man must pass through
all the ways of life, and so a carnal
nature was full manifest, a nature that
sprang forth from fleshly things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a foe a soldier never knows
his strength, and thought must be
developed by the exercise of strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so this carnal nature soon became
a foe that man must fight, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
might be the strength of God made
manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let every living thing stand still
and hear!</p>

<p>&#8220;Man is the lord of all the plane of
manifests; of protoplast, of mineral, of
plant, of beast; but he has given up his
birthright, just to gratify his lower self,
his carnal self.</p>

<p>&#8220;But man will full regain his lost
estate, his heritage; but he must do it in
a conflict that cannot be told in words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, he must suffer trials and temptations
manifold; but let him know that
cherubim and seraphim that rule the
stations of the sun, and spirits of the
mighty God who rule the solar stars are
his protectors and his guides, and they
will lead to victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man will be fully saved, redeemed,
perfected by the things he suffers on the
plane of flesh, and on the plane of soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;When man has conquered carnal
things his garb of flesh will then have
served its purpose well and it will fall,
will be no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he will stand untrammeled on
the plane of soul where he must full
complete his victories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unnumbered foes will stand before
the man upon the plane of soul; there
he must overcome, yea, overcome them
every one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus hope will ever be his beacon
light; there is no failure for the human
soul, for God is leading on and victory
is sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man cannot die; the spirit man is
one with God, and while God lives man
cannot die.</p>

<p>&#8220;When man has conquered every foe
upon the plane of soul the seed will have
full opened out, will have unfolded in the
Holy Breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;The garb of soul will then have
served its purpose well, and man will
need it never more, and it will pass and
be no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And man will then attain unto the
blessedness of perfectness and be at one
with God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Palestine. Birth of Mary. Joachim&#8217;s
feast. Mary is blest by
the priests. His prophecy. Mary
abides in the temple. Is betrothed
to Joseph.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Augustus</span> Cæsar reigned and
Herod Antipas was ruler of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Three provinces comprised
the land of Palestine: Judea, and
Samaria, and Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Joachim was a master of the
Jewish law, a man of wealth; he
lived in Nazareth of Galilee; and
Anna, of the tribe of Judah, was his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> To them was born a child, a
goodly female child, and they were
glad; and Mary was the name they
gave the child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Joachim made a feast in honor
of the child; but he invited not the
rich, the honored and the great; he
called the poor, the halt, the lame,
the blind, and to each one he gave a
gift of raiment, food, or other needful
thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> He said, The Lord has given
me this wealth; I am his steward
by his grace, and if I give not to his
children when in need, then he will
make this wealth a curse.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, when the child was three
years old her parents took her to
Jerusalem, and in the temple she
received the blessings of the priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The high priest was a prophet
and a seer, and when he saw the
child he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold, this child will be the
mother of an honored prophet and
a master of the law; she shall abide
within this holy temple of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Mary did abide within
the temple of the Lord; and Hillel,
chief of the Sanhedrim, taught her
all the precepts of the Jews, and she
delighted in the law of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> When Mary reached the age
of womanhood she was betrothed to
Joseph, son of Jacob, and a carpenter
of Nazareth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Joseph was an upright
man; and a devoted Essenes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Near</span> Hebron in the hills of
Judah, Zacharias and Elizabeth
abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They were devout and just,
and every day they read the Law,
the Prophets and the Psalms which
told of one to come, strong to redeem;
and they were waiting for
the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now, Zacharias was a priest,
and in his turn he led the temple
service in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> It came to pass as Zacharias
stood before the Lord and burned
the incense in the Holy Place, that
Gabriel came and stood before his

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Zacharias was afraid; he
thought that some great evil was
about to come upon the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But Gabriel said, O man of
God, fear not; I bring to you, and all
the world, a message of good will,
and peace on earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Behold, the Prince of Peace,
the king you seek, will quickly
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Your wife will bear to you a
son, a holy son, of whom the prophet
wrote,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold, I send Elijah unto
you again before the coming of the
Lord; and he will level down the
hills and fill the valleys up, and
pave the way for him who shall
redeem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> From the beginning of the
age your son has borne the name of
John, the mercy of the Lord; his
name is John.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He will be honored in the
sight of God, and he will drink no
wine, and from his birth he will be
filled with Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Gabriel stood before
Elizabeth as she was in the silence
in her home, and told her all the
words that he had said to Zacharias
in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> When he had done the service
of his course, the priest went
home, and with Elizabeth rejoiced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Five months passed by and
Gabriel came to Mary in her home
in Nazareth and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Hail Mary, hail! Once blessed
in the name of God; twice blessed in
the name of Holy Breath; thrice
blessed in the name of Christ; for
you are worthy, and will bear a son
who shall be called Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> His name is Jesus, for he
saves his people from their sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> When Joseph&#8217;s daily task
was done he came, and Mary told
him all the words that Gabriel
spoke to her, and they rejoiced; for
they believed that he, the man of
God, had spoken words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Mary went with haste
to tell Elizabeth about the promises
of Gabriel; together they rejoiced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And in the home of Zacharias
and Elizabeth did Mary tarry
ninety days; then she returned to
Nazareth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> To Zacharias and Elizabeth
a son was born, and Zacharias said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Most blessed be the name of
God, for he has opened up the fount
of blessings for his people, Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> His promises are verified;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
for he has brought to pass the words
which holy prophets spoke in olden
times.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Zacharias looked upon
the infant John, and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> You will be called the prophet
of the Holy One; and you will go
before his face, and will prepare his
way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And you will give a knowledge
of salvation unto Israel; and
you will preach the gospel of repentance
and the blotting out of
sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Behold, for soon the Day
Star from on high will visit us, to
light the way for those who sit
within the darkness of the shadowland,
and guide our feet unto the
ways of peace.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> time was nearly due for
Jesus to be born, and Mary
longed to see Elizabeth, and she and
Joseph turned their faces toward
the Judean hills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And when upon their way
they came to Bethlehem the day
was done, and they must tarry for
the night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> But Bethlehem was thronged
with people going to Jerusalem; the
inns and homes were filled with
guests, and Joseph and his wife
could find no place to rest but in a
cave where animals were kept; and
there they slept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> At midnight came a cry, A
child is born in yonder cave among
the beasts. And lo, the promised
son of man was born.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And strangers took the little
one and wrapped him in the dainty
robes that Mary had prepared and
laid him in a trough from which the
beasts of burden fed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Three persons clad in snow-white
robes came in and stood before
the child and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> All strength, all wisdom and
all love be yours, Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, on the hills of Bethlehem
were many flocks of sheep
with shepherds guarding them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The shepherds were devout,
were men of prayer, and they were
waiting for a strong deliverer to
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And when the child of promise
came a man in snow-white robe
appeared to them, and they fell
back in fear. The man stood forth
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Fear not! behold I bring
you joyful news. At midnight in a
cave in Bethlehem was born the
prophet and the king that you have
long been waiting for.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then the shepherds all
were glad; they felt that all the hills
were filled with messengers of light,
who said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> All glory be to God on high;
peace, peace on earth, good will
to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then the shepherds came
with haste to Bethlehem and to the
cave, that they might see and honor
him whom men had called Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, when the morning
came, a shepherdess whose home
was near, prepared a room for Mary,
Joseph and the child; and here they
tarried many days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Joseph sent a messenger
in haste to Zacharias and Elizabeth
to say, The child is born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Zacharias and Elizabeth
took John and came to Bethlehem
with words of cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">18</span> And Mary and Elizabeth recounted
all the wondrous things
that had transpired. The people
joined with them in praising God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> According to the custom of
the Jews, the child was circumcised;
and when they asked, What will
you call the child? the mother said,
His name is Jesus, as the man of
God declared.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Consecration of Jesus. Mary offers
sacrifices. Simeon and Anna
prophesy. Anna is rebuked for

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Mary took her son, when
he was forty days of age, up to
the temple in Jerusalem, and he was
consecrated by the priest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then she offered purifying
sacrifices for herself, according to
the custom of the Jews; a lamb and
two young turtle doves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> A pious Jew named Simeon
was in the temple serving God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> From early youth he had been
looking for Immanuel to come, and
he had prayed to God that he might
not depart until his eyes had seen
Messiah in the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when he saw the infant
Jesus he rejoiced and said, I now
am ready to depart in peace, for I
have seen the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then he took the infant
in his arms and said, Behold, this
child will bring a sword upon my

but he will break the sword and
then the nations will learn war no
more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The master&#8217;s cross I see upon
the forehead of this child, and he
will conquer by this sign.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And in the temple was a
widow, four and eighty years of age,
and she departed not, but night and
day she worshipped God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when she saw the infant
Jesus she exclaimed, Behold Immanuel!
Behold the signet cross
of the Messiah on his brow!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then the woman knelt
to worship him, as God with us, Immanuel;
but one, a master clothed
in white, appeared and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Good woman, stay; take
heed to what you do; you may not
worship man; this is idolatry.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> This child is man, the son of
man, and worthy of all praise. You
shall adore and worship God; him
only shall you serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The woman rose and bowed
her head in thankfulness and worshipped
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Mary took the infant
Jesus and returned to Bethlehem.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_5">CHAPTER 5.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Three magian priests honor Jesus.
Herod is alarmed. Calls a council
of the Jews. Is told that prophets
had foretold the coming of a king.
Herod resolves to kill the child.
Mary and Joseph take Jesus and
flee into Egypt.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> the river Euphrates
the magians lived; and they
were wise, could read the language
of the stars and they divined that
one, a master soul, was born; they
saw his star above Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And there were three among
the magian priests who longed to
see the master of the coming age;
and they took costly gifts and hastened
to the West in search of him,
the new-born king, that they might
honor him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And one took gold, the symbol
of nobility; another myrrh, the
symbol of dominion and of power;
gum-thus the other took, the symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of the wisdom of the sage.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Now when the magians
reached Jerusalem the people were
amazed, and wondered who they
were and why they came.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when they asked, Where
is the child that has been born a
king? the very throne of Herod
seemed to shake.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Herod sent a courtier
forth to bring the magians to his
court.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And when they came they
asked again, Where is the new born
king? And then they said, While
yet beyond the Euphrates we saw
his star arise, and we have come
to honor him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Herod blanched with
fear. He thought, perhaps, the
priests were plotting to restore the
kingdom of the Jews, and so he said
within himself, I will know more
about this child that has been born
a king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And so he told the magian
priests to tarry in the city for a
while and he would tell them all
about the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He called in council all the
Jewish masters of the law and
asked, What have the Jewish
prophets said concerning such a
one?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The Jewish masters answered
him and said, The prophets long ago
foretold that one would come to
rule the tribes of Israel; that this
Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> They said, The prophet Micah
wrote, O Bethlehem Judea, a
little place among the Judean hills,
yet out of you will one come forth
to rule my people, Israel; yea, one
who lived in olden times, in very
ancient days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Then Herod called the magian
priests again and told them
what the masters of the Jewish law
had said; and then he sent them on
the way to Bethlehem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> He said, Go search, and if
you find the child that has been
born a king, return and tell me all,
that I may go and honor him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The magians went their way
and found the child with Mary in
the shepherd&#8217;s home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They honored him; bestowed
upon him precious gifts and gave
him gold, gum-thus and myrrh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> These magian priests could
read the hearts of men; they read
the wickedness of Herod&#8217;s heart,
and knew that he had sworn to
kill the new born king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And so they told the secret
to the parents of the child, and bid
them flee beyond the reach of harm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the priests went
on their homeward way; they went
not through Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Joseph took the infant
Jesus and his mother in the night
and fled to Egypt land, and with
Elihu and Salome in ancient Zoan
they abode.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when the magian priests
did not return to tell him of
the child that had been born a
king, King Herod was enraged.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then his courtiers told

one born to go before and to prepare
the people to receive the
king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> This angered more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the king; he called his guards and
bid them go to Bethlehem and slay
the infant John, as well as Jesus
who was born to be a king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He said, Let no mistake be
made, and that you may be sure to
slay these claimants to my throne,
slay all male children in the town
not yet two years of age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The guards went forth and did
as Herod bade them do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Elizabeth knew not that Herod
sought to slay her son, and she
and John were yet in Bethlehem;
but when she knew, she took the
infant John and hastened to the
hills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The murderous guards were
near; they pressed upon her hard;
but then she knew the secret caves
in all the hills, and into one she ran
and hid herself and John until the
guards were gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Their cruel task was done; the
guards returned and told the story
to the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They said, We know that we
have slain the infant king; but John,
his harbinger, we could not find.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The king was angry with his
guards because they failed to slay
the infant John; he sent them to the
tower in chains.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And other guards were sent
to Zacharias, father of the harbinger,
while he was serving in the
Holy Place, to say, The king demands
that you shall tell where is
your son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But Zacharias did not know,
and he replied, I am a minister of
God, a servant in the Holy Place;
how could I know where they have
taken him?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And when the guards returned
and told the king what Zacharias
said, he was enraged and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> My guards, go back and tell
that wily priest that he is in my
hands; that if he does not tell the
truth, does not reveal the hiding
place of John, his son, then he shall
die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The guards went back and
told the priest just what the king
had said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Zacharias said, I can
but give my life for truth; and if the
king does shed my blood the Lord
will save my soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The guards again returned
and told the king what Zacharias
said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Now, Zacharias stood before
the altar in the Holy Place engaged
in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> A guard approached and
with a dagger thrust him through;
he fell and died before the curtain
of the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And when the hour of salutation
came, for Zacharias daily
blessed the priests, he did not come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And after waiting long the
priests went to the Holy Place and
found the body of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And there was grief, deep
grief, in all the land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Now Herod sat upon his

his courtiers came; the king was
dead. His sons reigned in his

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> son of Herod, Archelaus,
reigned in Jerusalem. He was
a selfish, cruel king; he put to death
all those who did not honor him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> He called in council all the
wisest men and asked about the
infant claimant to his throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The council said that John
and Jesus both were dead; then he
was satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Now Joseph, Mary and their

and John was with his mother in
the Judean hills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Elihu and Salome sent messengers
in haste to find Elizabeth
and John. They found them and
they brought them to Zoan.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Now, Mary and Elizabeth
were marveling much because of
their deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Elihu said, It is not strange;
there are no happenings; law governs
all events.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> From olden times it was ordained
that you should be with us,
and in this sacred school be taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Elihu and Salome took Mary

grove near by where they were wont
to teach.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Elihu said to Mary and Elizabeth,
You may esteem yourselves
thrice blest, for you are chosen
mothers of long promised sons,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Who are ordained to lay in
solid rock a sure foundation stone
on which the temple of the perfect

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> An age has passed; the gate
unto another age flies open at the
touch of time. This is the preparation
age of soul, the kingdom of Immanuel,
of God in man;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And these, your sons, will be
the first to tell the news, and preach
the gospel of good will to men, and
peace on earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> A mighty work is theirs; for
carnal men want not the light; they
love the dark, and when the light
shines in the dark they comprehend
it not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> We call these sons, Revealers
of the Light; but they must
have the light before they can reveal
the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And you must teach your
sons, and set their souls on fire with
love and holy zeal, and make them
conscious of their missions to the
sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Teach them that God and
man were one; but that through
carnal thoughts and words and
deeds, man tore himself away from
God; debased himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Teach that the Holy Breath
would make them one again, restoring
harmony and peace;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> That naught can make them
one but love; that God so loved the
world that he has clothed his son in
flesh that man may comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The only Savior of the world
is love, and Jesus, son of Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
comes to manifest that love to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Now, love cannot be manifest
until its way has been prepared,
and naught can rend the rocks and
bring down lofty hills and fill the
valleys up, and thus prepare the
way, but purity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But purity in life men do not
comprehend; and so, it, too, must
come in flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And you, Elizabeth, are blest
because your son is purity made
flesh, and he shall pave the way for
love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> This age will comprehend
but little of the works of Purity and
Love; but not a word is lost, for in
the Book of God&#8217;s Remembrance a
registry is made of every thought,
and word, and deed;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And when the world is ready
to receive, lo, God will send a messenger
to open up the book and
copy from its sacred pages all the
messages of Purity and Love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Then every man of earth will
read the words of life in language of
his native land, and men will see
the light, walk in the light and

one with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The lower self breeds hatred,

higher self is mother of the virtues

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The lower self is rich in promises,

peace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying
gains; but gives unrest and
misery and death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The only devil from which
men must be redeemed is self, the
lower self. If man would find his
devil he must look within; his name
is self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> If man would find his savior
he must look within; and when the
demon self has been dethroned the
savior, Love, will be exalted to the
throne of power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The David of the light is
Purity, who slays the strong Goliath
of the dark, and seats the savior,
Love, upon the throne.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Salome&#8217;s lessons. The man and the
woman. Philosophy of human
moods. The triune God. The
Septonate. The God Tao.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Salome</span> taught the lesson of the
day. She said, All times are
not alike. Today the words of
man may have the greatest power;
tomorrow women teaches best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> In all the ways of life the man
and woman should walk hand in
hand; the one without the other is
but half; each has a work to do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> But all things teach; each has
a time and season for its own. The
sun, the moon have lessons of their
own for men; but each one teaches
at the appointed time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The lessons of the sun fall
down on human hearts like withered
leaves upon a stream, if given in the
season of the moon; and so with
lessons of the moon and all the stars.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Today one walks in gloom,
downhearted and oppressed; tomorrow
that same one is filled with
joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Today the heavens seem full
of blessedness and hope; tomorrow
hope has fled, and every plan and
purpose comes to naught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Today one wants to curse the
very ground on which he treads; tomorrow
he is full of love and praise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Today one hates and scorns
and envies and is jealous of the
child he loves; tomorrow he has
risen above his carnal self, and
breathes forth gladness and good
will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> A thousand times men wonder
why these heights and depths, these
light hearts and these sad, are found
in every life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> They do not know that there
are teachers everywhere, each busy
with a God-appointed task, and
driving home to human hearts the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But this is true, and every
one receives the lessons that he
needs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Mary said, Today I am
in exaltation great; my thoughts
and all my life seem lifted up; why
am I thus inspired?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Salome replied, This is a day
of exaltation; day of worship and of
praise; a day when, in a measure,
we may comprehend our Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> Then let us study God, the
One, the Three, the Seven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Before the worlds were
formed all things were One; just
Spirit, Universal Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Spirit breathed, and
that which was not manifest became
the Fire and Thought of heaven,
the Father-God, the Mother-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And when the Fire and
Thought of heaven in union
breathed, their son, their only son,
was born. This son is Love whom
men have called the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Men call the Thought of
heaven the Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And when the Triune God
breathed forth, lo, seven Spirits
stood before the throne. These are
the Elohim, creative spirits of the
universe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And these are they who said,
Let us make man; and in their image
man was made.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> In early ages of the world
the dwellers in the farther East said,
Tao is the name of Universal
Breath; and in the ancient books we
read,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> No manifesting form has
Tao Great, and yet he made and
keeps the heavens and earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> No passion has our Tao
Great, and yet he causes sun and
moon and all the stars to rise and
set.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> No name has Tao Great, and
yet he makes all things to grow; he
brings in season both the seed time
and the harvest time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Tao Great was One; the
One became the Two; the Two became
the Three, the Three evolved
the Seven, which filled the universe
with manifests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Tao Great gives unto
all, the evil and the good, the rain,
the dew, the sunshine and the flowers;
from his rich stores he feeds
them all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And in the same old book we
read of man: He has a spirit knit
to Tao Great; a soul which lives
within the seven Breaths of Tao
Great; a body of desires that
springs up from the soil of flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Now spirit loves the pure,
the good, the true; the body of desires
extols the selfish self; the soul
becomes the battle ground between
the two.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And blessed is the man
whose spirit is triumphant and
whose lower self is purified; whose
soul is cleansed, becoming fit to be
the council chamber of the manifests
of Tao Great.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Thus closed the lesson of
Salome.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Elihu&#8217;s lessons. The Brahmic religion.
Life of Abram. Jewish
sacred books. The Persian religion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Elihu</span> taught; he said, In ancient
times a people in the
East were worshippers of God, the
One, whom they called Brahm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Their laws were just; they
lived in peace; they saw the light
within; they walked in wisdom&#8217;s
ways.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> But priests with carnal aims
arose, who changed the laws to suit
the carnal mind; bound heavy burdens
on the poor, and scorned the
rules of right; and so the Brahms
became corrupt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> But in the darkness of the age
a few great masters stood unmoved;
they loved the name of Brahm;
they were great beacon lights before
the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And they preserved inviolate
the wisdom of their holy Brahm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and you may read this wisdom in
their sacred books.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And in Chaldea, Brahm was
known. A pious Brahm named
Terah lived in Ur; his son was so
devoted to the Brahmic faith that
he was called A-Brahm; and he was
set apart to be the father of the
Hebrew race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, Terah took his wife and
sons and all his flocks and herds to
Haran in the West; here Terah
died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Abram took the flocks
and herds, and with his kindred
journeyed further west;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when he reached the
Oaks of Morah in the land of Canaan,
he pitched his tents and there
abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A famine swept the land and
Abram took his kindred and his
flocks and herds and came to
Egypt, and in these fertile plains
of Zoan pitched his tent, and here
abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And men still mark the place
where Abram lived&mdash;across the
plain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> You ask why Abram came
to Egypt land? This is the cradleland
of the initiate; all secret things
belong to Egypt land; and this is
why the masters come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> In Zoan Abram taught his
science of the stars, and in that sacred
temple over there he learned
the wisdom of the wise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And when his lessons all were
learned, he took his kindred and his
flocks and herds and journeyed
back to Canaan, and in the plains
of Mamre pitched his tent, and there
he lived, and there he died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And records of his life and
works and of his sons, and of the
tribes of Israel, are well preserved
in Jewish sacred books.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> In Persia Brahm was known,
and feared. Men saw him as the
One, the causeless Cause of all that
is, and he was sacred unto them,
as Tao to the dwellers of the farther
East.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The people lived in peace,
and justice ruled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But, as in other lands, in Persia
priests arose imbued with self
and self desires, who outraged
Force, Intelligence and Love;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Religion grew corrupt, and
birds and beasts and creeping things
were set apart as gods.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> In course of time a lofty soul,
whom men called Zarathustra, came
in flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> He saw the causeless Spirit,
high and lifted up; he saw the weakness
of all man appointed gods.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> He spoke and all of Persia
heard; and when he said, One God,
one people and one shrine, the altars
of the idols fell, and Persia was redeemed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But men must see their God
with human eyes, and Zarathustra
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The greatest of the Spirits
standing near the throne is the
Ahura Mazda, who manifests in
brightness of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And all the people saw
Ahura Mazda in the sun, and they
fell down and worshipped him in
temples of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Persia is the magian
land where live the priests who
saw the star arise to mark the place
where Mary&#8217;s son was born, and
were the first to greet him as the
Prince of Peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The precepts and the laws of
Zarathustra are preserved in the
Avesta which you can read and
make your own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But you must know that
words are naught till they are made
alive; until the lessons they contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
become a part of head and heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Now truth is one; but no one
knows the truth until he is the truth.
It is recorded in an ancient book,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Truth is the leavening power
of God; it can transmute the all of
life into itself; and when the all of
life is truth, then man is truth.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_11">CHAPTER 11.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Elihu&#8217;s lessons. Buddhism and the
precepts of Buddha. The mysteries
of Egypt.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Again</span> Elihu taught; he said,
The Indian priests became
corrupt; Brahm was forgotten in
the streets; the rights of men were
trampled in the dust.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then a mighty master
came, a Buddha of enlightenment,
who turned away from wealth and
all the honors of the world, and
found the Silence in the quiet groves
and caves; and he was blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> He preached a gospel of a
higher life, and taught man how to
honor man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He had no doctrine of the gods
to teach; he just knew man, and so
his creed was justice, love and righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> I quote for you a few of many
of the helpful words which Buddha
spoke:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Hate is a cruel word. If men
hate you, regard it not; and you can
turn the hate of men to love and
mercy and good will, and mercy is as
large as all the heavens.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And there is good enough for
all. With good destroy the bad;
with generous deeds make avarice
ashamed; with truth make straight
the crooked lines that error draws,
for error is but truth distorted, gone
astray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And pain will follow him who
speaks or acts with evil thoughts,
as does the wheel the foot of him
who draws the cart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> He is a greater man who conquers
self than he who kills a thousand
men in war.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He is the noble man who is
himself what he believes that other
men should be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Return to him who does you
wrong your purest love, and he will
cease from doing wrong; for love
will purify the heart of him who is
beloved as truly as it purifies the
heart of him who loves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The words of Buddha are recorded
in the Indian sacred books;
attend to them, for they are part
of the instructions of the Holy
Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The land of Egypt is the land
of secret things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The mysteries of the ages lie
lock-bound in our temples and our
shrines.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The masters of all times and
climes come here to learn; and when
your sons have grown to manhood
they will finish all their studies in
Egyptian schools.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> But I have said enough.
Tomorrow at the rising of the sun
we meet again.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Salome&#8217;s lessons. Prayer. Elihu&#8217;s
concluding lessons. Sums up the

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when the morning sun
arose the masters and their
pupils all were in the sacred grove.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Salome was the first to speak;
she said, Behold the sun! It manifests
the power of God who speaks
to us through sun and moon and
stars;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Through mountain, hill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
vale; through flower, and plant and
tree.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> God sings for us through bird,
and harpsichord, and human voice;
he speaks to us through wind and
rain and thunder roll; why should
we not bow down and worship at
his feet?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> God speaks to hearts apart;
and hearts apart must speak to him;
and this is prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> It is not prayer to shout at
God, to stand, or sit, or kneel and
tell him all about the sins of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> It is not prayer to tell the
Holy One how great he is, how good
he is, how strong and how compassionate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> God is not man to be bought up
by praise of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Prayer is the ardent wish that
every way of life be light; that every
act be crowned with good; that
every living thing be prospered by
our ministry.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A noble deed, a helpful word
is prayer; a fervent, an effectual
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The fount of prayer is in the
heart; by thought, not words, the
heart is carried up to God, where it is
blest. Then let us pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> They prayed, but not a word
was said; but in that holy Silence
every heart was blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then Elihu spoke. He
said to Mary and Elizabeth, Our
words are said; you need not tarry
longer here; the call has come; the
way is clear, you may return unto
your native land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> A mighty work is given you
to do; you shall direct the minds
that will direct the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Your sons are set apart to
lead men up to righteous thoughts,
and words, and deeds;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> To make men know the sinfulness
of sin; to lead them from the
adoration of the lower self, and all
illusive things, and make them conscious
of the self that lives with
Christ in God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> In preparation for their work
your sons must walk in many
thorny paths.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Fierce trials and temptations
they will meet, like other men;
their loads will not be light, and
they will weary be, and faint.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And they will know the
pangs of hunger and of thirst; and
without cause they will be mocked,
imprisoned, scourged.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> To many countries they will
go, and at the feet of many masters
they will sit, for they must learn
like other men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> But we have said enough.
The blessings of the Three and of
the Seven, who stand before the
throne, will surely rest upon you
evermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Thus closed the lessons of
Elihu and Salome. Three years
they taught their pupils in the sacred
grove, and if their lessons all
were written in a book, lo, it would
be a mighty book; of what they
said we have the sum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Now, Mary, Joseph and Elizabeth
with Jesus and his harbinger,
set forth upon their homeward way.
They went not by Jerusalem, for
Archelaus reigned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> They journeyed by the Bitter
Sea, and when they reached Engedi
hills they rested in the home of
Joshua, a near of kin; and here Elizabeth
and John abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But Joseph, Mary and their
son went by the Jordan way, and
after certain days they reached their

<i>Childhood and Early Education of John the Harbinger.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_13">CHAPTER 13.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Elizabeth in Engedi. Teaches her
son. John becomes the pupil of
Matheno, who reveals to him the
meaning of sin and the law of forgiveness.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> was blest; she spent
her time with John, and gave
to him the lessons that Elihu and
Salome had given her.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And John delighted in the
wildness of his home and in the lessons
that he learned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now in the hills were many
caves. The cave of David was
a-near in which the Hermit of Engedi
lived.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This hermit was Matheno,
priest of Egypt, master from the
temple of Sakara.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When John was seven years
of age Matheno took him to the wilderness
and in the cave of David
they abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Matheno taught, and John
was thrilled with what the master
said, and day by day Matheno
opened up to him the mysteries of
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> John loved the wilderness; he
loved his master and his simple fare.
Their food was fruits, and nuts,
wild honey and the carob bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Matheno was an Israelite,
and he attended all the Jewish
feasts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> When John was nine years old
Matheno took him to a great feast
in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The wicked Archelaus had
been deposed and exiled to a distant
land because of selfishness and cruelty,
and John was not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> John was delighted with his
visit to Jerusalem. Matheno told
him all about the service of the
Jews; the meaning of their sacrifices
and their rites.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> John could not understand
how sin could be forgiven by killing
animals and birds and burning them
before the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Matheno said, The God of
heaven and earth does not require
sacrifice. This custom with its
cruel rites was borrowed from the
idol worshippers of other lands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> No sin was ever blotted out
by sacrifice of animal, of bird, or
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Sin is the rushing forth of
man into the fens of wickedness.
If one would get away from sin he
must retrace his steps, and find his
way out of the fens of wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Return and purify your
hearts by love and righteousness
and you shall be forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> This is the burden of the message
that the harbinger shall bring
to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> What is forgiveness? John
inquired.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Matheno said, It is the paying
up of debts. A man who wrongs
another man can never be forgiven
until he rights the wrong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The Vedas says that none
can right the wrong but him who
does the wrong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> John said, If this be true
where is the power to forgive except
the power that rests in man himself?
Can man forgive himself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Matheno said, The door is
wide ajar; you see the way of man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
return to right, and the forgiveness
of his sins.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_14">CHAPTER 14.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Matheno&#8217;s lessons. The doctrine of
universal law. The power of man
to choose and to attain. The benefits
of antagonisms. Ancient sacred
books. The place of John and
Jesus in the world&#8217;s history.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Matheno</span> and his pupil, John,
were talking of the sacred
books of olden times, and of the
golden precepts they contained, and
John exclaimed,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> These golden precepts are sublime;
what need have we of other
sacred books?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Matheno said, The Spirits of
the Holy One cause every thing to
come and go in proper time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The sun has his own time to
set, the moon to rise, to wax and
wane, the stars to come and go, the
rain to fall, the winds to blow;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The seed times and the harvest
times to come; man to be born
and man to die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> These mighty Spirits cause the
nations to be born; they rock them
in their cradles, nurture them to
greatest power, and when their tasks
are done they wrap them in their
winding sheets and lay them in
their tombs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Events are many in a nation&#8217;s
life, and in the life of man, that are
not pleasant for the time; but in the
end the truth appears: whatever
comes is for the best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Man was created for a noble
part; but he could not be made a
free man filled with wisdom, truth
and might.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> If he were hedged about, confined
in straits from which he
could not pass, then he would be a
toy, a mere machine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Creative spirits gave to man
a will; and so he has the power to
choose.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He may attain the greatest
heights, or sink to deepest depths;
for what he wills to gain he has the
power to gain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If he desires strength he has
the power to gain that strength;
but he must overcome resistances
to reach the goal; no strength is
ever gained in idleness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> So, in the whirl of many-sided
conflicts man is placed where
he must strive to extricate himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> In every conflict man gains
strength; with every conquest he
attains to greater heights. With
every day he finds new duties and
new cares.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Man is not carried over dangerous
pits, nor helped to overcome
his foes. He is himself his army,
and his sword and shield; and he is
captain of his hosts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The Holy Ones just light his
way. Man never has been left without
a beacon light to guide.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And he has ever had a
lighted lamp in hand that he may
see the dangerous rocks, the turbid
streams and treacherous pits.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And so the Holy Ones have
judged; when men have needed
added light a master soul has come
to earth to give that light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Before the Vedic days the
world had many sacred books to
light the way; and when man needed
greater light the Vedas, the Avesta
and the books of Tao Great appeared
to show the way to greater
heights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And in the proper place the
Hebrew Bible, with its Law, its

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">When</span> John was twelve years
old his mother died, and
neighbors laid her body in a tomb
among her kindred in the Hebron
burying ground, and near to Zacharias&#8217;
tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And John was deeply grieved;
he wept. Matheno said, It is not
well to weep because of death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Death is no enemy of man; it
is a friend who, when the work of
life is done, just cuts the cord that
binds the human boat to earth, that
it may sail on smoother seas.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> No language can describe a
mother&#8217;s worth, and yours was
tried and true. But she was not
called hence until her tasks were
done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The calls of death are always
for the best, for we are solving problems
there as well as here; and one
is sure to find himself where he can
solve his problems best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> It is but selfishness that
makes one wish to call again to
earth departed souls.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Then let your mother rest in
peace. Just let her noble life be
strength and inspiration unto you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> A crisis in your life has come,
and you must have a clear conception
of the work that you are called
to do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The sages of the ages call you
harbinger. The prophets look to
you and say, He is Elijah come
again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Your mission here is that of
harbinger; for you will go before
Messiah&#8217;s face to pave his way, and
make the people ready to receive
their king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> This readiness is purity of
heart; none but the pure in heart
can recognize the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> To teach men to be pure in
heart you must yourself be pure in
heart, and word, and deed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> In infancy the vow for you
was made and you became a Nazarite.
The razor shall not touch your
face nor head, and you shall taste
not wine nor fiery drinks.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Men need a pattern for their
lives; they love to follow, not to
lead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The man who stands upon
the corners of the paths and points
the way, but does not go, is just a
pointer; and a block of wood can do
the same.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The teacher treads the way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
on every span of ground he leaves
his footprints clearly cut, which all
can see and be assured that he, their
master, went that way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Men comprehend the inner
life by what they see and do. They
come to God through ceremonies
and forms.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And so when you would
make men know that sins are
washed away by purity in life, a
rite symbolic may be introduced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> In water wash the bodies of
the people who would turn away
from sin and strive for purity in
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> This rite of cleansing is a
preparation rite and they who thus
are cleansed comprise the Church of
Purity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And you shall say, You men
of Israel, hear; Reform and wash;
become the sons of purity, and you
shall be forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> This rite of cleansing and
this church are but symbolic of the
cleansing of the soul by purity in
life, and of the kingdom of the soul,
which does not come with outward
show, but is the church within.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Now, you may never point
the way and tell the multitudes to
do what you have never done; but
you must go before and show the
way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> You are to teach that men
must wash; so you must lead the
way, your body must be washed,
symbolic of the cleansing of the
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> John said, Why need I wait?
May I not go at once and wash?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Matheno said, &#8217;Tis well, and
then they went down to the Jordan
ford, and east of Jericho, just where
the hosts of Israel crossed when
first they entered Canaan, they
tarried for a time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Matheno taught the harbinger,
and he explained to him the
inner meaning of the cleansing rite
and how to wash himself and how
to wash the multitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And in the river Jordan
John was washed; then they returned
unto the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Now in Engedi&#8217;s hills Matheno&#8217;s
work was done and he and
John went down to Egypt. They
rested not until they reached the
temple of Sakara in the valley of
the Nile.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> For many years Matheno
was a master in this temple of the
Brotherhood, and when he told
about the life of John and of his
mission to the sons of men, the hierophant
with joy received the harbinger
and he was called the Brother
Nazarite.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> For eighteen years John
lived and wrought within these temple
gates; and here he conquered
self, became a master mind and
learned the duties of the harbinger.</p>

<i>Childhood and Early Education of Jesus.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_16">CHAPTER 16.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The home of Joseph. Mary teaches
her son. Jesus&#8217; grandparents give
a feast in his honor. Jesus has a
dream. His grandmother&#8217;s interpretation.
His birthday gift.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> home of Joseph was on
Marmion Way in Nazareth;
here Mary taught her son the lessons
of Elihu and Salome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus greatly loved the
Vedic hymns and the Avesta; but
more than all he loved to read the
Psalms of David and the pungent
words of Solomon.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The Jewish books of prophecy
were his delight; and when he
reached his seventh year he needed
not the books to read, for he had
fixed in memory every word.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Joachim and his wife, grandparents
of child Jesus, made a feast
in honor of the child, and all their
near of kin were guests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus stood before the
guests and said, I had a dream, and
in my dream I stood before a sea,
upon a sandy beach.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The waves upon the sea were
high; a storm was raging on the
deep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Some one above gave me a
wand. I took the wand and touched
the sand, and every grain of sand
became a living thing; the beach
was all a mass of beauty and of song.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> I touched the waters at my
feet, and they were changed to
trees, and flowers, and singing birds,
and every thing was praising God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And some one spoke, I did not
see the one who spoke, I heard the
voice, which said, There is no death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Grandmother Anna loved the
child; she laid her hand on Jesus&#8217;
head and said, I saw you stand
beside the sea; I saw you touch the
sand and waves; I saw them turn
to living things and then I knew the
meaning of the dream.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The sea of life rolls high; the
storms are great. The multitude
of men are idle, listless, waiting,
like dead sand upon the beach.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Your wand is truth. With
this you touch the multitudes, and
every man becomes a messenger of
holy light and life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> You touch the waves upon
the sea of life; their turmoils cease;
the very winds become a song of
praise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> There is no death, because
the wand of truth can change the
dryest bones to living things, and
bring the lovliest flowers from stagnant
ponds, and turn the most discordant
notes to harmony and
praise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Joachim said, My son, today
you pass the seventh milestone
of your way of life, for you are seven
years of age, and we will give to
you, as a remembrance of this day,
whatever you desire; choose that
which will afford you most delight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, I do not
want a gift, for I am satisfied. If
I could make a multitude of children
glad upon this day I would be
greatly pleased.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Now, there are many hungry
boys and girls in Nazareth who
would be pleased to eat with us this
feast and share with us the pleasures
of this day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The richest gift that you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
give to me is your permission to go
out and find these needy ones and
bring them here that they may
feast with us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Joachim said, &#8217;Tis well; go
out and find the needy boys and
girls and bring them here; we will
prepare enough for all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus did not wait; he
ran; he entered every dingy hut and
cabin of the town; he did not waste
his words; he told his mission everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And in a little time one hundred
and three-score of happy, ragged
boys and girls were following
him up Marmion Way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The guests made way; the
banquet hall was filled with Jesus&#8217;
guests, and Jesus and his mother
helped to serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And there was food enough
for all, and all were glad; and so the
birthday gift of Jesus was a crown
of righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus talks with the rabbi of the synagogue
of Nazareth. He criticises
the narrowness of Jewish thought.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Rabbi Barachia of the
synagogue of Nazareth, was
aid to Mary in the teaching of her
son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One morning after service in
the synagogue the rabbi said to
Jesus as he sat in silent thought,
Which is the greatest of the Ten
Commands?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, I do not see a
greatest of the Ten Commands. I
see a golden cord that runs through
all the Ten Commands that binds
them fast and makes them one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This cord is love, and it belongs
to every word of all the Ten
Commands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> If one is full of love he can do
nothing else than worship God; for
God is love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> If one is full of love, he cannot
kill; he cannot falsely testify; he
cannot covet; can do naught but
honor God and man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> If one is full of love he does not
need commands of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Rabbi Barachia said,
Your words are seasoned with the
salt of wisdom that is from above.
Who is the teacher who has opened
up this truth to you?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, I do not know
that any teacher opens up this
truth for me. It seems to me that
truth was never shut; that it was
always opened up, for truth is one
and it is everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And if we open up the windows
of our minds the truth will
enter in and make herself at home;
for truth can find her way through
any crevice, any window, any open
door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The rabbi said, What hand
is strong enough to open up the
windows and the doors of mind so
truth can enter in?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, It seems to
me that love, the golden cord that
binds the Ten Commands in one, is
strong enough to open any human
door so that the truth can enter in
and cause the heart to understand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Now, in the evening Jesus
and his mother sat alone, and Jesus
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The rabbi seems to think
that God is partial in his treatment
of the sons of men; that Jews are
favored and are blest above all
other men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> I do not see how God can
have his favorites and be just.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Are not Samaritans and
Greeks and Romans just as much
the children of the Holy One as are
the Jews?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">17</span> I think the Jews have built
a wall about themselves, and they
see nothing on the other side of it.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> They do not know that flowers
are blooming over there; that
sowing times and reaping times
belong to anybody but the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> It surely would be well if we
could break these barriers down so
that the Jews might see that God
has other children that are just as
greatly blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I want to go from Jewry land
and meet my kin in other countries
of my Fatherland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus at a feast in Jerusalem. Is
grieved by the cruelties of the sacrificers.
Appeals to Hillel, who
sympathizes with him. He remains
in the temple a year.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> great feast of the Jews was
on, and Joseph, Mary and their
son, and many of their kin, went to
Jerusalem. The child was ten
years old.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus watched the butchers
kill the lambs and birds and
burn them on the altar in the name
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> His tender heart was shocked
at this display of cruelty; he asked
the serving priest, What is the purpose
of this slaughter of the beasts
and birds? Why do you burn their
flesh before the Lord?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The priest replied, This is our
sacrifice for sin. God has commanded
us to do these things, and
said that in these sacrifices all our
sins are blotted out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Will you be
kind enough to tell when God proclaimed
that sins are blotted out by
sacrifice of any kind?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Did not David say that God
requires not a sacrifice for sin? that
it is sin itself to bring before his face
burnt offerings, as offerings for sin?
Did not Isaiah say the same?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The priest replied, My child,
you are beside yourself. Do you
know more about the laws of God
than all the priests of Israel? This
is no place for boys to show their
wit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> But Jesus heeded not his
taunts; he went to Hillel, chief of
the Sanhedrim, and he said to him,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Rabboni, I would like to talk
with you; I am disturbed about this
service of the pascal feast. I
thought the temple was the house
of God where love and kindness
dwell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Do you not hear the bleating
of those lambs, the pleading of those
doves that men are killing over
there? Do you not smell that awful
stench that comes from burning
flesh?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Can man be kind and just,
and still be filled with cruelty?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> A God that takes delight in
sacrifice, in blood and burning flesh,
is not my Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> I want to find a God of love,
and you, my master, you are wise,
and surely you can tell me where to
find the God of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But Hillel could not give an
answer to the child. His heart was
stirred with sympathy. He called
the child to him; he laid his hand
upon his head and wept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> He said, There is a God of
love, and you shall come with me;
and hand in hand we will go forth
and find the God of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Why need we
go? I thought that God is everywhere.
Can we not purify our
hearts and drive out cruelty, and
every wicked thought, and make
within, a temple where the God of
love can dwell?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">17</span> The master of the great Sanhedrim
felt as though he was himself
the child, and that before him
stood Rabboni, master of the higher
law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> He said within himself, This
child is surely prophet sent from
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Then Hillel sought the parents
of the child, and asked that
Jesus might abide with him, and
learn the precepts of the law, and all
the lessons of the temple priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> His parents gave consent,
and Jesus did abide within the holy
temple in Jerusalem, and Hillel
taught him every day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And every day the master
learned from Jesus many lessons of
the higher life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The child remained with
Hillel in the temple for a year, and
then returned unto his home in Nazareth;
and there he wrought with
Joseph as a carpenter.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_19">CHAPTER 19.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus at the age of twelve in the
temple. Disputes with the doctors

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Again</span> the great feast in Jerusalem
was on, and Joseph, Mary
and their son were there. The child
was twelve years old.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And there were Jews and
proselytes from many countries in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus sat among the
priests and doctors in the temple
hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus opened up a book
of prophecy and read:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Woe, woe, to Ariel, the town
where David dwelt! I will dismantle
Ariel, and she shall groan and
weep:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And I will camp against her
round about with hostile posts;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And I will bring her low and
she shall speak out of the earth;
with muffled voice like a familiar
spirit shall she speak; yea, she shall
only whisper forth her speech;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And foes unnumbered, like
the grains of dust, shall come upon
her suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The Lord of hosts will visit
her with thunder and with tempest,
and with storm; with earthquake,
and with devouring flames.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Lo, all these people have deserted
me. They draw to me with
speech, and with their lips they
honor me; their hearts are far removed
from me; their fear for me is
that inspired by man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And I will breathe an adverse
breath upon my people, Israel;
the wisdom of their wise men
shall be lost; the understanding of
their prudent men shall not be
found.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> My people seek to hide their
counsel from the Lord, so that their
works may not be seen. They fain
would cover up their works with
darkness of the night, and say, Who
sees us now? Who knows us now?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Poor, foolish men! shall that
which has been made say of its
maker, He is naught, I made myself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Or shall the pot speak out
and say to him, who made the pot,
You have no skill; you do not know?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But this will not forever be;
the time will come when Lebanon
will be a fruitful field, and fruitful
fields will be transformed to groves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And on that day the deaf
will hear the words of God; the
blind will read the Book of God&#8217;s
Remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And suffering ones will be relieved,
and they will have abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
joy; and every one that needs will
be supplied; and it will come to pass
that all the foolish will be wise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The people will return and
sanctify the Holy One, and in their
heart of hearts, lo, they will reverence
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> When Jesus had thus read
he put aside the book and said,
You masters of the law, will you
make plain for us the prophet&#8217;s
words?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Now, Hillel sat among the
masters of the law, and he stood
forth and said, Perhaps our young
rabboni who has read the word
will be interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said, The Ariel of
the prophet is our own Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> By selfishness and cruelty
this people has become a stench unto
the Elohim.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The prophet saw these days
from far, and of these times he
wrote.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Our doctors, lawyers, priests
and scribes oppress the poor, while
they themselves in luxury live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The sacrifices and the offerings
of Israel are but abomination
unto God. The only sacrifice that
God requires is self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Because of this injustice and
this cruelty of man to man, the Holy
One has spoken of this commonwealth:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Lo, I will overturn, yes, I will
overturn, it shall be overturned, and
it shall be no more until he comes
whose right it is and I will give it
unto him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> In all the world there is one
law of right, and he who breaks that
law will suffer grief; for God is just.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Israel has gone far
astray; has not regarded justice,
nor the rights of man, and God demands
that Israel shall reform, and
turn again to ways of holiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And if our people will not
hear the voice of God, lo, nations
from afar will come and sack Jerusalem,
and tear our temple down,
and take our people captive into
foreign lands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> But this will not forever be;
though they be scattered far and
wide, and wander here and there
among the nations of the earth,
like sheep that have no shepherd
guide,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The time will come when God
will bring again the captive hosts;
for Israel shall return and dwell in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And after many years our

their kindred who were on their way
to Galilee; but they had seen him
not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Then Joseph, Mary, and a son
of Zebedee, returned and sought
through all Jerusalem, but they
could find him not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">5</span> And then they went up to the
temple courts and asked the guards,
Have you seen Jesus, a fair-haired
boy, with deep blue eyes, twelve
years of age, about these courts?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The guards replied, Yes, he is
in the temple now disputing with
the doctors of the law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And they went in, and found
him as the guards had said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Mary said, Why Jesus,
why do you treat your parents thus?
Lo, we have sought two days for
you. We feared that some great
harm had overtaken you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, Do you not
know that I must be about my
Father&#8217;s work?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> But he went round and
pressed the hand of every doctor of
the law and said, I trust that we
may meet again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And then he went forth with
his parents on their way to Nazareth;
and when they reached their
home he wrought with Joseph as a
carpenter.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> One day as he was bringing
forth the tools for work he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> These tools remind me of
the ones we handle in the workshop
of the mind where things are made
of thought and where we build up
character.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> We use the square to measure
all our lines, to straighten out
the crooked places of the way, and
make the corners of our conduct
square.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> We use the compass to draw
circles round our passions and desires
to keep them in the bounds of
righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> We use the ax to cut away
the knotty, useless and ungainly
parts and make the character symmetrical.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> We use the hammer to drive
home the truth, and pound it in
until it is a part of every part.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> We use the plane to smooth
the rough, uneven surfaces of joint,
and block, and board that go to
build the temple for the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The chisel, line, the plummet
and the saw all have their uses in
the workshop of the mind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then this ladder with its
trinity of steps, faith, hope and love;
on it we climb up to the dome of
purity in life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And on the twelve-step ladder
we ascend until we reach the
pinnacle of that which life is spent
to build&mdash;the Temple of Perfected
Man.</p>

<i>Life and Works of Jesus in India.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_21">CHAPTER 21.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Ravanna sees Jesus in the temple
and is captivated. Hillel tells him
about the boy. Ravanna finds Jesus
in Nazareth and gives a feast in his
honor. Ravanna becomes patron
of Jesus, and takes him to India to
study the Brahmic religion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> royal prince of India, Ravanna
of Orissa in the south,
was at the Jewish feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Ravanna was a man of wealth;
and he was just, and with a band of
Brahmic priests sought wisdom in
the West.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> When Jesus stood among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Jewish priests and read and spoke,
Ravanna heard and was amazed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And when he asked who
Jesus was, from whence he came and
what he was, chief Hillel said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> We call this child the Day
Star from on high, for he has come
to bring to men a light, the light of
life; to lighten up the way of men
and to redeem his people, Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Hillel told Ravanna all
about the child; about the prophecies
concerning him; about the wonders
of the night when he was born;
about the visit of the magian
priests;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> About the way in which he
was protected from the wrath of
evil men; about his flight to Egypt-land,
and how he then was serving
with his father as a carpenter in Nazareth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Ravanna was entranced, and
asked to know the way to Nazareth,
that he might go and honor such a
one as son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And with his gorgeous train
he journeyed on the way and came
to Nazareth of Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He found the object of his
search engaged in building dwellings
for the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when he first saw Jesus
he was climbing up a twelve-step
ladder, and he carried in his hands
a compass, square and ax.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Ravanna said, All hail, most
favored son of heaven!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And at the inn Ravanna
made a feast for all the people of the
town; and Jesus and his parents
were the honored guests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> For certain days Ravanna
was a guest in Joseph&#8217;s home on
Marmion Way; he sought to learn
the secret of the wisdom of the son;
but it was all too great for him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then he asked that he
might be the patron of the child;
might take him to the East where he
could learn the wisdom of the
Brahms.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus longed to go that
he might learn: and after many
days his parents gave consent.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then, with proud heart,
Ravanna with his train, began the
journey toward the rising sun; and
after many days they crossed the
Sind, and reached the province of
Orissa, and the palace of the prince.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The Brahmic priests were
glad to welcome home the prince;
with favor they received the Jewish
boy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus was accepted as
a pupil in the temple Jagannath;
and here he learned the Vedas and
the Manic laws.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The Brahmic masters wondered
at the clear conceptions of the
child, and often were amazed when
he explained to them the meaning
of the laws.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_22">CHAPTER 22.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The friendship of Jesus and Lamaas.
Jesus explains to Lamaas the
meaning of truth, man, power,
understanding, wisdom, salvation
and faith.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the priests of Jagannath
was one who loved the Jewish
boy. Lamaas Bramas was the
name by which the priest was
known.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One day as Jesus and Lamaas
walked alone in plaza Jagannath,
Lamaas said, My Jewish master,
what is truth?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, Truth is the
only thing that changes not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> In all the world there are two
things; the one is truth; the other
falsehood is; and truth is that which
is, and falsehood that which seems
to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">5</span> Now truth is aught, and has
no cause, and yet it is the cause of
everything.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Falsehood is naught, and yet
it is the manifest of aught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Whatever has been made will
be unmade; that which begins must
end.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> All things that can be seen by
human eyes are manifests of aught,
are naught, and so must pass away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The things we see are but reflexes
just appearing, while the
ethers vibrate so and so, and when
conditions change they disappear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The Holy Breath is truth;
is that which was, and is, and evermore
shall be; it cannot change nor
pass away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Lamaas said, You answer
well; now, what is man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, Man is the
truth and falsehood strangely
mixed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Man is the Breath made
flesh; so truth and falsehood are
conjoined in him; and then they
strive, and naught goes down and
man as truth abides.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Again Lamaas asked, What
do you say of power?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, It is a manifest;
is the result of force; it is but
naught; it is illusion, nothing more.
Force changes not, but power
changes as the ethers change.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Force is the will of God and is
omnipotent, and power is that will
in manifest, directed by the Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> There is a power in the
winds, a power in the waves, a
power in the lightning&#8217;s stroke, a
power in the human arm, a power
in the eye.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The ethers cause these powers
to be, and thought of Elohim,
of angel, man, or other thinking
thing, directs the force; when it has
done its work the power is no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Again Lamaas asked, Of understanding
what have you to say?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, It is the rock
on which man builds himself; it is
the gnosis of the aught and of the
naught, of falsehood and of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> It is the knowledge of the
lower self; the sensing of the powers
of man himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Again Lamaas asked, Of wisdom
what have you to say?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, It is the consciousness
that man is aught; that
God and man are one;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> That naught is naught; that
power is but illusion; that heaven
and earth and hell are not above,
around, below, but in; which in the
light of aught becomes the naught,
and God is all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Lamaas asked, Pray, what
is faith?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, Faith is the
surety of the omnipotence of God
and man; the certainty that man
will reach deific life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Salvation is a ladder reaching
from the heart of man to heart
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> It has three steps; Belief is
first, and this is what man thinks,
perhaps, is truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And faith is next, and this is
what man knows is truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Fruition is the last, and this
is man himself, the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Belief is lost in faith; and in
fruition faith is lost; and man is
saved when he has reached deific
life; when he and God are one.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and Lamaas among the sudras
and visyas. In Benares.
Jesus becomes a pupil of Udraka.
The lessons of Udraka.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Jesus with his friend Lamaas
went through all the regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of Orissa, and the valley of the
Ganges, seeking wisdom from the
sudras and the visyas and the
masters.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Benares of the Ganges was a
city rich in culture and in learning;
here the two rabbonis tarried many
days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus sought to learn the
Hindu art of healing, and became
the pupil of Udraka, greatest of
the Hindu healers.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Udraka taught the uses of the
waters, plants and earths; of heat
and cold; sunshine and shade; of
light and dark.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He said, The laws of nature
are the laws of health, and he who
lives according to these laws is
never sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Transgression of these laws is
sin, and he who sins is sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> He who obeys the laws, maintains
an equilibrium in all his parts,
and thus insures true harmony; and
harmony is health, while discord is
disease.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> That which produces harmony
in all the parts of man is medicine,
insuring health.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The body is a harpsichord,
and when its strings are too relaxed,
or are too tense, the instrument is
out of tune, the man is sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, everything in nature
has been made to meet the wants
of man; so everything is found in
medical arcanes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when the harpsichord
of man is out of tune the vast expanse
of nature may be searched
for remedy; there is a cure for every
ailment of the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Of course the will of man is
remedy supreme; and by the vigorous
exercise of will, man may make
tense a chord that is relaxed, or may
relax one that is too tense, and thus
may heal himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> When man has reached the
place where he has faith in God, in
nature and himself, he knows the
Word of power; his word is balm
for every wound, is cure for all the
ills of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The healer is the man who
can inspire faith. The tongue may
speak to human ears, but souls are
reached by souls that speak to
souls.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> He is the forceful man whose
soul is large, and who can enter into
souls, inspiring hope in those who
have no hope, and faith in those who
have no faith in God, in nature, nor
in man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> There is no universal balm
for those who tread the common
walks of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> A thousand things produce
inharmony and make men sick; a
thousand things may tune the harpsichord,
and make men well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> That which is medicine for
one is poison for another one; so
one is healed by what would kill
another one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> An herb may heal the one;
a drink of water may restore another
one; a mountain breeze may bring
to life one seeming past all help;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> A coal of fire, or bit of
earth, may cure another one; and
one may wash in certain streams,
or pools, and be made whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The virtue from the hand or
breath may heal a thousand more;
but love is queen. Thought, reinforced
by love, is God&#8217;s great sovereign
balm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> But many of the broken
chords in life, and discords that so
vex the soul, are caused by evil
spirits of the air that men see not;
that lead men on through ignorance
to break the laws of nature and of
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> These powers act like demons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
and they speak; they rend
the man; they drive him to despair.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But he who is a healer, true,
is master of the soul, and can, by
force of will, control these evil ones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Some spirits of the air are
master spirits and are strong, too
strong for human power alone; but
man has helpers in the higher
realms that may be importuned,
and they will help to drive the demons
out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Of what this great physician
said, this is the sum. And Jesus
bowed his head in recognition of the
wisdom of this master soul, and
went his way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Brahmic doctrine of castes.
Jesus repudiates it and teaches human
equality. The priests are
offended and drive him from the
temple. He abides with the sudras
and teaches them.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Four</span> years the Jewish boy
abode in temple Jagannath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One day he sat among the
priests and said to them, Pray, tell
me all about your views of castes;
why do you say that all men are
not equal in the sight of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> A master of their laws stood
forth and said, The Holy One whom
we call Brahm, made men to suit
himself, and men should not complain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> In the beginning days of human
life Brahm spoke, and four
men stood before his face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Now, from the mouth of Parabrahm
the first man came; and he
was white, was like the Brahm himself;
a brahman he was called.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And he was high and lifted up;
above all want he stood; he had no
need of toil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And he was called the priest
of Brahm, the holy one to act for
Brahm in all affairs of earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The second man was red, and
from the hand of Parabrahm he
came; and he was called shatriya.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And he was made to be the
king, the ruler and the warrior,
whose highest ordained duty was,
protection of the priest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And from the inner parts of
Parabrahm the third man came;
and he was called a visya.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He was a yellow man, and
his it was to till the soil, and keep
the flocks and herds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And from the feet of Parabrahm
the fourth man came; and
he was black; and he was called the
sudras, one of low estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The sudras is the servant of
the race of men; he has no rights
that others need respect; he may
not hear the Vedas read, and it
means death to him to look into
the face of priest, or king, and
naught but death can free him from
his state of servitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, Then Parabrahm
is not a God of justice and
of right; for with his own strong
hand he has exalted one and brought
another low.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said no more to
them, but looking up to heaven he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> My Father-God, who was,
and is, and ever more shall be; who
holds within thy hands the scales
of justice and of right;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Who in the boundlessness of
love has made all men to equal be.
The white, the black, the yellow
and the red can look up in thy face
and say, Our Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Thou Father of the human
race, I praise thy name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And all the priests were angered
by the words which Jesus
spoke; they rushed upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
seized him, and would have done
him harm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> But then Lamaas raised his
hand and said, You priests of
Brahm, beware! you know not what
you do; wait till you know the God
this youth adores.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I have beheld this boy at
prayer when light above the light of
sun surrounded him, Beware! his
God may be more powerful than
Brahm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> If Jesus speaks the truth, if
he is right, you cannot force him to
desist; if he is wrong and you are
right, his words will come to naught,
for right is might, and in the end it
will prevail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then the priests refrained
from doing Jesus harm; but
one spoke out and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Within this holy place has
not this reckless youth done violence
to Parabrahm? The law is plain;
it says, He who reviles the name of
Brahm shall die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Lamaas plead for Jesus&#8217; life;
and then the priests just seized a
scourge of cords and drove him
from the place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus went his way and
found a shelter with the black and
yellow men, the servants and the
tillers of the soil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> To them he first made known
the gospel of equality; he told them
of the Brotherhood of Man, the
Fatherhood of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The common people heard
him with delight, and learned to
pray, Our Father-God who art in
heaven.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches the sudras and farmers.
Relates a parable of a nobleman
and his unjust sons. Makes
known the possibilities of all men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jesus saw the sudras and
the farmers in such multitudes
draw near to hear his words,
he spoke a parable to them; he said:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A nobleman possessed a great
estate; he had four sons, and he
would have them all grow strong by
standing forth and making use of
all the talents they possessed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And so he gave to each a share
of his great wealth, and bade them
go their way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The eldest son was full of self;
he was ambitious, shrewd and quick
of thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He said within himself, I am
the oldest son, and these, my brothers,
must be servants at my feet,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then he called his brothers
forth; and one he made a puppet
king; gave him a sword and charged
him to defend the whole estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> To one he gave the use of
lands and flowing wells, and flocks
and herds, and bade him till the soil,
and tend the flocks and herds and
bring to him the choicest of his
gains.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And to the other one he said,
You are the youngest son; the
broad estate has been assigned; you
have no part nor lot in anything
that is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then he took a chain and
bound his brother to a naked rock
upon a desert plain, and said to
him,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> You have been born a slave;
you have no rights, and you must
be contented with your lot, for
there is no release for you until you
die and go from hence.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Now, after certain years the
day of reckoning came; the nobleman
called up his sons to render
their accounts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And when he knew that one,
his eldest son, had seized the whole
estate and made his brothers slaves,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">13</span> He seized him, tore his
priestly robes away and put him in
a prison cell, where he was forced to
stay until he had atoned for all the
wrongs that he had done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then, as though they
were but toys, he threw in air the
throne and armor of the puppet
king; he broke his sword, and put
him in a prison cell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then he called his farmer
son and asked him why he had not
rescued from his galling chains his
brother on the desert sands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And when the son made answer
not, the father took unto himself
the flocks and herds, the fields
and flowing wells,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And sent his farmer son to
live out on the desert sands, until
he had atoned for all the wrongs
that he had done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then the father went
and found his youngest son in cruel
chains; with his own hands he broke
the chains and bade his son to go in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Now, when the sons had all
paid up their debts they came again
and stood before the bar of right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They all had learned their
lessons, learned them well; and then
the father once again divided the
estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> He gave to each an equal
share, and bade them recognize the
law of equity and right, and live in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And one, a sudras, spoke and
said, May we who are but slaves,
who are cut down like beasts to satisfy
the whims of priests&mdash;may we
have hope that one will come to
break our chains and set us free?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, The Holy
One has said, that all his children
shall be free; and every soul is child
of God.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus at Katak. The car of Jagannath.
Jesus reveals to the people
the emptiness of Brahmic rites,
and how to see God in man.
Teaches them the divine law of sacrifice.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> all the cities of Orissa Jesus
taught. At Katak, by the river
side, he taught, and thousands of
the people followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One day a car of Jagannath
was hauled along by scores of frenzied
men, and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Behold, a form without a
spirit passes by; a body with no
soul; a temple with no altar fires.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This car of Krishna is an
empty thing, for Krishna is not
there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> This car is but an idol of a
people drunk on wine of carnal
things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> God lives not in the noise of
tongues; there is no way to him
from any idol shrine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> God&#8217;s meeting place with
man is in the heart, and in a still
small voice he speaks; and he who
hears is still.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And all the people said, Teach
us to know the Holy One who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
speaks within the heart, God of the
still small voice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, The Holy
Breath cannot be seen with mortal
eyes; nor can men see the Spirits
of the Holy One;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> But in their image man was
made, and he who looks into the
face of man, looks at the image of
the God who speaks within.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when man honors man
he honors God, and what man does
for man, he does for God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And you must bear in mind
that when man harms in thought,
or word or deed another man, he
does a wrong to God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> If you would serve the God
who speaks within the heart, just
serve your near of kin, and those
that are no kin, the stranger at
your gates, the foe who seeks to do
you harm;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Assist the poor, and help the
weak; do harm to none, and covet
not what is not yours;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Then, with your tongue the
Holy One will speak; and he will
smile behind your tears, will light
your countenance with joy, and fill
your hearts with peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And then the people asked,
To whom shall we bring gifts?
Where shall we offer sacrifice?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, Our Father-God
asks not for needless waste of
plant, of grain, of dove, of lamb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> That which you burn on any
shrine you throw away. No blessings
can attend the one who takes
the food from hungry mouths to be
destroyed by fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> When you would offer sacrifice
unto our God, just take your
gift of grain, or meat and lay it on
the table of the poor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> From it an incense will arise
to heaven, which will return to you
with blessedness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Tear down your idols; they
can hear you not; turn all your sacrificial
altars into fuel for the flames.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Make human hearts your altars,
and burn your sacrifices with
the fire of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And all the people were entranced,
and would have worshipped
Jesus as a God; but Jesus
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> I am your brother man just
come to show the way to God; you
shall not worship man; praise God,
the Holy One.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> fame of Jesus as a teacher
spread through all the land,

to hear his words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> At Behar, on the sacred river

days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Ach, a wealthy man of
Behar, made a feast in honor of his
guest, and he invited every one to
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And many came; among them
thieves, extortioners, and courtesans.
And Jesus sat with them
and taught; but they who followed
him were much aggrieved because
he sat with thieves and courtesans.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And they upbraided him;
they said, Rabboni, master of the
wise, this day will be an evil day for
you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The news will spread that you
consort with courtesans and thieves,
and men will shun you as they shun

for sake of reputation or of
fame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> These are but worthless baubles
of the day; they rise and sink,
like empty bottles on a stream;
they are illusions and will pass

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They are the indices to what
the thoughtless think; they are the
noise that people make; and shallow
men judge merit by the noise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> God and all master men
judge men by what they are and
not by what they seem to be; not
by their reputation and their fame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> These courtesans and thieves
are children of my Father-God;
their souls are just as precious in
his sight as yours, or of the Brahmic
priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And they are working out
the same life sums that you, who
pride yourselves on your respectability
and moral worth, are working
out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And some of them have
solved much harder sums than you
have solved, you men who look at
them with scorn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Yes, they are sinners, and
confess their guilt, while you are
guilty, but are shrewd enough to
have a polished coat to cover up
your guilt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Suppose you men who scorn
these courtesans, these drunkards
and these thieves, who know that
you are pure in heart and life, that
you are better far than they, stand
forth that men may know just who
you are.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The sin lies in the wish, in
the desire, not in the act.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> You covet other people&#8217;s
wealth; you look at charming forms,
and deep within your hearts you
lust for them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Deceit you practice every
day, and wish for gold, for honor
and for fame, just for your selfish
selves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The man who covets is a
thief, and she who lusts is courtesan.
You who are none of these speak
out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Nobody spoke; the accusers
held their peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said, The proof
this day is all against those who
have accused.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The pure in heart do not accuse.
The vile in heart who want
to cover up their guilt with holy
smoke of piety are ever loathing
drunkard, thief and courtesan.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> This loathing and this scorn
is mockery, for if the tinseled coat
of reputation could be torn away,
the loud professor would be found
to revel in his lust, deceit, and many
forms of secret sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The man who spends his
time in pulling other people&#8217;s weeds
can have no time to pull his own,
and all the choicest flowers of life
will soon be choked and die, and
nothing will remain but darnel,
thistles, burs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Jesus spoke a parable:
he said, Behold, a farmer had great
fields of ripened grain, and when he
looked he saw that blades of many
stalks of wheat were bent and broken
down.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And when he sent his reapers
forth he said, We will not save
the stalks of wheat that have the
broken blades.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Go forth and cut and burn
the stalks with broken blades.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And after many days he
went to measure up his grain, but
not a kernel could he find.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then he called the harvesters
and said to them, Where is
my grain?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> They answered him and said,
We did according to your word; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
gathered up and burned the stalks
with broken blades, and not a stalk
was left to carry to the barn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Jesus said, If God saves
only those who have no broken
blades, who have been perfect in
his sight, who will be saved?</p>

heads in shame; and Jesus went his

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Benares</span> is the sacred city of

Jesus taught; Udraka was his host.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Udraka made a feast in honor

Hindu priests and scribes were
there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said to them, With
much delight I speak to you concerning
life&mdash;the brotherhood of
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The universal God is one, yet
he is more than one; all things are
God; all things are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> By the sweet breaths of God
all life is bound in one; so if you
touch a fiber of a living thing you
send a thrill from center to the outer
bounds of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And when you crush beneath
your foot the meanest worm, you
shake the throne of God, and cause
the sword of right to tremble in its
sheath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The bird sings out its song for
men, and men vibrate in unison to
help it sing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The ant constructs her home,
the bee its sheltering comb, the

breathe to them a spirit in their
sweet perfumes that gives them
strength to toil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Now, men and birds and
beasts and creeping things are deities,
made flesh; and how dare men
kill anything?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> &#8217;Tis cruelty that makes the
world awry. When men have
learned that when they harm a living
thing they harm themselves,
they surely will not kill, nor cause
a thing that God has made to suffer
pain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> A lawyer said, I pray you,
Jesus, tell who is this God you speak

temples and his shrines?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, The God I
speak about is every where; he cannot
be compassed with walls, nor
hedged about with bounds of any
kind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> All people worship God, the
One; but all the people see him not
alike.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> This universal God is wisdom,
will and love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> All men see not the Triune
God. One sees him as the God of
might; another as the God of
thought; another as the God of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> A man&#8217;s ideal is his God, and
so, as man unfolds, his God unfolds.
Man&#8217;s God today, tomorrow is not
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The nations of the earth see
God from different points of view,
and so he does not seem the same to
every one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Man names the part of God
he sees, and this to him is all of God;
and every nation sees a part of God,
and every nation has a name for
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> You Brahmans call him Parabrahm;
in Egypt he is Thoth; and
Zeus is his name in Greece; Jehovah
is his Hebrew name; but everywhere
he is the causeless Cause, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
rootless Root from which all things
have grown.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> When men become afraid of
God, and take him for a foe, they
dress up other men in fancy garbs
and call them priests,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And charge them to restrain
the wrath of God by prayers; and
when they fail to win his favor by
their prayers, to buy him off with
sacrifice of animal, or bird,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> When man sees God as one
with him, as Father-God, he needs
no middle man, no priest to intercede;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> He goes straight up to him
and says, My Father-God! and then
he lays his hand in God&#8217;s own hand,
and all is well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And this is God. You are,
each one, a priest, just for yourself;
and sacrifice of blood God does not
want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Just give your life in sacrificial
service to the all of life, and
God is pleased.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> When Jesus had thus said
he stood aside; the people were
amazed, but strove among themselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Some said, He is inspired by
Holy Brahm; and others said, He is
insane; and others said, He is obsessed;
he speaks as devils speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But Jesus tarried not.
Among the guests was one, a tiller
of the soil, a generous soul, a seeker
after truth, who loved the words
that Jesus spoke; and Jesus went
with him, and in his home abode.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Among</span> Benares&#8217; temple priests

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> By merchantmen Ajainin

himself and journeyed from Lahore
that he might see the boy, and hear

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The Brahmic priests did not
accept the truth that Jesus brought,
and they were angered much by
what he said at the Udraka feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> But they had never seen the
boy, and they desired much to hear
him speak, and they invited him to
be a temple guest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> But Jesus said to them, The

for all; if you would see the light
come to the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> If you would hear the message

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, when the priests were
told what Jesus said they were enraged.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Ajainin did not share their
wrath, and he sent forth another
messenger with costly gifts to Jesus
at the farmer&#8217;s home; he sent this
message with the gifts:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> I pray you, master, listen to
my words; The Brahmic law forbids
that any priest shall go into the
home of any one of low estate; but
you can come to us;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And I am sure these priests
will gladly hear you speak. I pray
that you will come and dine with us
this day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, The Holy
One regards all men alike; the
dwelling of my host is good enough
for any council of the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If pride of caste keeps you
away, you are not worthy of the

the laws of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">13</span> Your presents I return; you
cannot buy the knowledge of the
Lord with gold, or precious gifts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> These words of Jesus angered
more and more the priests,
and they began to plot and plan
how they might drive him from the
land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Ajainin did not join with
them in plot and plan; he left the
temple in the night, and sought the
home where Jesus dwelt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, There is no
night where shines the sun; I have
no secret messages to give; in light
all secrets are revealed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Ajainin said, I came from
far-away Lahore, that I might
learn about this ancient wisdom,
and this kingdom of the Holy One
of which you speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Where is the kingdom?
where the king? Who are the subjects?
what its laws?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said, This kingdom
is not far away, but man with
mortal eyes can see it not; it is within
the heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> You need not seek the king
in earth, or sea, or sky; he is not
there, and yet is everywhere. He
is the Christ of God; is universal
love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The gate of this dominion
is not high, and he who enters it
must fall down on his knees. It is
not wide, and none can carry carnal
bundles through.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The lower self must be transmuted
into spirit-self; the body
must be washed in living streams
of purity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Ajainin asked, Can I become
a subject of this king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus said, You are
yourself a king, and you may enter
through the gate and be a subject
of the King of kings.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But you must lay aside your
priestly robes; must cease to serve
the Holy One for gold; must give
your life, and all you have, in willing
service to the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said no more;
Ajainin went his way; and while he
could not comprehend the truth
that Jesus spoke, he saw what he
had never seen before.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The realm of faith he never
had explored; but in his heart the
seeds of faith and universal brotherhood
had found good soil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And as he journeyed to his
home he seemed to sleep, to pass
through darkest night, and when he
woke the Sun of Righteousness had
arisen; he had found the king.</p>

many days and taught.</p>

none can comfort her. She wonders
whether you are still alive or
not; she longs to see you once again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus bowed his head in
silent thought; and then he wrote.
Of what he wrote this is the sum:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> My mother, noblest of woman
kind; A man just from my native
land has brought me word that
father is no more in flesh, and that

problems of the round of soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Our Father-God is with him
there, as he was with him here; and
there his angel guards his footsteps
lest he goes astray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Why should you weep? Tears
cannot conquer grief. There is no
power in grief to mend a broken
heart.</p>

the busy soul can never grieve; it
has no time for grief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> When grief comes trooping
through the heart, just lose yourself;
plunge deep into the ministry
of love, and grief is not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Yours is a ministry of love,
and all the world is calling out for
love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Then let the past go with the
past; rise from the cares of carnal
things and give your life for those
who live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And if you lose your life in
serving life you will be sure to find
in it the morning sun, the evening
dews, in song of bird, in flowers, and

problems of this earth-round will be

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The world is looking on; the
very life of Brahmic thought is now
on trial.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> If we are reason-blind; if
prejudice be king today; if we resort
to beastly force, and dye our
hands in blood that may, in sight of
Brahm, be innocent and pure,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> His vengeance may fall down
on us; the very rock on which we
stand may burst beneath our feet;
and our beloved priesthood, and our
laws and shrines will go into decay.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But they would let him
speak no more. The wrathful
priests rushed up and beat him, spit
upon him, called him traitor, threw
him, bleeding, to the street.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then confusion reigned;
the priests became a mob; the sight
of human blood led on to fiendish
acts, and called for more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The rulers, fearing war,
sought Jesus, and they found him
calmly teaching in the market-place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They urged him to depart,
that he might save his life; but he
refused to go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And then the priests sought
cause for his arrest; but he had done
no crime.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then false charges were
preferred; but when the soldiers
went to bring him to the judgment
hall they were afraid, because the
people stood in his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The priests were baffled, and
they resolved to take his life by
stealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They found a man who was
a murderer by trade, and sent him
out by night to slay the object of
their wrath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Lamaas heard about their
plotting and their plans, and sent a
messenger to warn his friend; and
Jesus hastened to depart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> By night he left Benares,
and with haste he journeyed to the
north; and everywhere, the farmers,
merchants and the sudras helped
him on his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And after many days he
reached the mighty Himalayas,
and in the city Kapivastu he abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The priests of Buddha opened
wide their temple doors for him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and Barata. Together they
read the sacred books. Jesus takes
exception to the Buddhist doctrine
of evolution and reveals the true
origin of man. Meets Vidyapati,
who becomes his co-laborer.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the Buddhist priests was
one who saw a lofty wisdom in
the words that Jesus spoke. It was
Barata Arabo.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Together Jesus and Barata
read the Jewish Psalms and Prophets;
read the Vedas, the Avesta and
the wisdom of Guatama.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And as they read and talked
about the possibilities of man, Barata
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Man is the marvel of the universe.
He is a part of everything,
for he has been a living thing on
every plane of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Time was when man was not;
and then he was a bit of formless
substance in the molds of time; and
then a protoplast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> By universal law all things
tend upward to a state of perfectness.
The protoplast evolved, becoming
worm, then reptile, bird and
beast, and then at last it reached
the form of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, man himself is mind,
and mind is here to gain perfection
by experience; and mind is often
manifest in fleshy form, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
form best suited to its growth. So
mind may manifest as worm, or
bird, or beast, or man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The time will come when everything
of life will be evolved unto
the state of perfect man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And after man is man in perfectness,
he will evolve to higher
forms of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said, Barata Arabo,
who taught you this, that mind,
which is the man, may manifest in
flesh of beast, or bird, or creeping
thing?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Barata said, From times
which man remembers not our
priests have told us so, and so we
know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, Enlightened
Arabo, are you a master mind and
do not know that man knows naught
by being told?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Man may believe what others
say; but thus he never knows.
If man would know, he must himself
be what he knows.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Do you remember, Arabo,
when you was ape, or bird, or
worm?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, if you have no better
proving of your plea than that the
priests have told you so, you do not
know; you simply guess.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Regard not, then, what any
man has said; let us forget the flesh,
and go with mind into the land of
fleshless things; mind never does
forget.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And backward through the
ages master minds can trace themselves;
and thus they know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Time never was when man
was not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> That which begins will have
an end. If man was not, the time
will come when he will not exist.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> From God&#8217;s own Record
Book we read: The Triune God
breathed forth, and seven Spirits
stood before his face. (The Hebrews
call these seven Spirits, Elohim.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And these are they who, in
their boundless power, created everything
that is, or was.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> These Spirits of the Triune
God moved on the face of boundless
space and seven ethers were, and
every ether had its form of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> These forms of life were but
the thoughts of God, clothed in the
substance of their ether planes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> (Men call these ether planes
the planes of protoplast, of earth, of
plant, of beast, of man, of angel and
of cherubim.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> These planes with all their
teeming thoughts of God, are never
seen by eyes of man in flesh; they
are composed of substance far too
fine for fleshly eyes to see, and still
they constitute the soul of things;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And with the eyes of soul all
creatures see these ether planes, and
all the forms of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Because all forms of life on
every plane are thoughts of God,
all creatures think, and every creature
is possessed of will, and, in its
measure, has the power to choose,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And in their native planes
all creatures are supplied with nourishment
from the ethers of their
planes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And so it was with every living
thing until the will became a
sluggish will, and then the ethers
of the protoplast, the earth, the
plant, the beast, the man, began to
vibrate very slow.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The ethers all became more
dense, and all the creatures of these
planes were clothed with coarser
garbs, the garbs of flesh, which men
can see; and thus this coarser manifest,
which men call physical, appeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And this is what is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
fall of man; but man fell not alone
for protoplast, and earth, and plant
and beast were all included in the
fall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The angels and the cherubim
fell not; their wills were ever strong,
and so they held the ethers of their
planes in harmony with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Now, when the ethers reached
the rate of atmosphere, and all the
creatures of these planes must get
their food from atmosphere, the conflict
came; and then that which the
finite man has called, survival of
the best, became a law,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The stronger ate the bodies
of the weaker manifests; and here
is where the carnal law of evolution
had its rise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And now man, in his utter
shamelessness, strikes down and eats
the beasts, the beast consumes the
plant, the plant thrives on the
earth, the earth absorbs the protoplast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> In yonder kingdom of the
soul this carnal evolution is not
known, and the great work of master
minds is to restore the heritage
of man, to bring him back to his estate
that he has lost, when he again
will live upon the ethers of his native
plane.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> The thoughts of God change
not; the manifests of life on every
plane unfold into perfection of their
kind; and as the thoughts of God
can never die, there is no death to
any being of the seven ethers of the
seven Spirits of the Triune God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And so an earth is never
plant; a beast, or bird, or creeping
thing is never man, and man is not,
and cannot be, a beast, or bird, or
creeping thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The time will come when all
these seven manifests will be absorbed,
and man, and beast, and
plant, and earth and protoplast
will be redeemed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Barata was amazed; the
wisdom of the Jewish sage was revelation
unto him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Now, Vidyapati, wisest of
the Indian sages, chief of temple
Kapavistu, heard Barata speak to
Jesus of the origin of man, and
heard the answer of the Hebrew
prophet, and he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> You priests of Kapavistu,
hear me speak: We stand today
upon a crest of time. Six times ago
a master soul was born who gave a
glory light to man, and now a master
sage stands here in temple Kapavistu.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> This Hebrew prophet is the
rising star of wisdom, deified. He
brings to us a knowledge of the secret
things of God; and all the world
will hear his words, will heed his
words, and glorify his name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> You priests of temple Kapavistu,
stay! be still and listen when
he speaks; he is the Living Oracle
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> And all the priests gave
thanks, and praised the Buddha of
enlightenment.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches the common people at a
spring. Tells them how to attain
unto happiness. Relates the parable
of the rocky field and the hidden
treasure.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> silent meditation Jesus sat
beside a flowing spring. It was
a holy day, and many people of the
servant caste were near the place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus saw the hard drawn
lines of toil on every brow, in every
hand. There was no look of joy in
any face. Not one of all the group
could think of anything but toil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus spoke to one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
said, Why are you all so sad? Have
you no happiness in life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The man replied, We scarcely
know the meaning of that word.
We toil to live, and hope for nothing
else but toil, and bless the day when
we can cease our toil and lay us
down to rest in Buddha&#8217;s city of
the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus&#8217; heart was stirred
with pity and with love for these
poor toilers, and he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Toil should not make a person
sad; men should be happiest
when they toil. When hope and
love are back of toil, then all of life
is filled with joy and peace, and
this is heaven. Do you not know
that such a heaven is for you?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The man replied, Of heaven
we have heard; but then it is so far
away, and we must live so many
lives before we reach that place!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, My brother,
man, your thoughts are wrong;
your heaven is not far away; and it
is not a place of metes and bounds,
is not a country to be reached; it is
a state of mind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> God never made a heaven for
man; he never made a hell; we are
creators and we make our own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, cease to seek for heaven
in the sky; just open up the
windows of your hearts, and, like a
flood of light, a heaven will come
and bring a boundless joy; then toil
will be no cruel task.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The people were amazed, and
gathered close to hear this strange
young master speak,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Imploring him to tell them
more about the Father-God; about
the heaven that men can make on
earth; about the boundless joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Jesus spoke a parable;
he said, A certain man possessed a
field; the soil was hard and poor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> By constant toil he scarcely
could provide enough of food to
keep his family from want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> One day a miner who could
see beneath the soil, in passing on
his way, saw this poor man and
his unfruitful field.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> He called the weary toiler
and he said, My brother, know you
not that just below the surface of
your barren field rich treasures lie
concealed?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> You plow and sow and reap
in scanty way, and day by day you
tread upon a mine of gold and precious
stones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> This wealth lies not upon the
surface of the ground; but if you
will but dig away the rocky soil,
and delve down deep into the earth,
you need no longer till the soil for
naught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The man believed. The
miner surely knows; he said, and
I will find the treasures hidden in
my field.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then he dug away the
rocky soil, and deep down in the
earth he found a mine of gold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said, The sons of
men are toiling hard on desert
plains, and burning sands and rocky
soils; are doing what their fathers
did, not dreaming they can do
aught else.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Behold, a master comes, and
tells them of a hidden wealth; that
underneath the rocky soil of carnal
things are treasures that no man
can count;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> That in the heart the richest
gems abound; that he who wills may
open up the door and find them all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then the people said,
Make known to us the way that we
may find the wealth that lies within
the heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Jesus opened up the
way; the toilers saw another side of
life, and toil became a joy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a gala day in sacred Kapavistu;
a throng of Buddhist
worshippers had met to celebrate
a Jubilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And priests and masters from

taught; but they embellished little

unkept; the vines were high, the

great.</p>

shut the sunlight from the vines;
the grapes were sour, and few, and
small.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The pruner came; with his
sharp knife he cut off every branch,
and not a leaf remained; just root
and stalk, and nothing more.</p>

one accord and were amazed, and
said to him who pruned, You foolish
man! the vineyard is despoiled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Such desolation! There is
no beauty left, and when the harvest
time shall come the gatherers
will find no fruit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The pruner said, Content
yourselves with what you think, and
come again at harvest time and see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when the harvest time
came on the busy neighbors came
again; they were surprised.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The naked stalks had put
forth branch and leaf, and heavy
clusters of delicious grapes weighed
every branch to earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The gatherers rejoiced as,
day by day, they carried the rich
fruitage to the press.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Behold, the vineyard of the
Lord! the earth is spread with human
vines.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The gorgeous forms and rites
of men are branches, and their
words are leaves; and these have
grown so great that sunlight can
no longer reach the heart; there is
no fruit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold, the pruner comes,
and with a two-edged knife he cuts
away the branches and the leaves
of words,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And naught is left but unclothed
stalks of human life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The priests and they of
pompous show, rebuke the pruner,

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus in Lassa. He meets Meng-ste
who aids him in reading the ancient
manuscripts. He goes to Ladak.
Heals a child. Relates the parable
of the king&#8217;s son.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> Lassa of Tibet there was a master&#8217;s
temple, rich in manuscripts
of ancient lore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The Indian sage had read
these manuscripts, and he revealed
to Jesus many of the secret lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
they contained; but Jesus wished
to read them for himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now, Meng-ste, greatest sage
of all the farther East, was in this
temple of Tibet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The path across Emodus
heights was difficult; but Jesus
started on his way, and Vidyapati
sent with him a trusted guide.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Vidyapati sent a message
to Meng-ste, in which he told
about the Hebrew sage, and spoke
for him a welcome by the temple
priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Now, after many days, and
perils great, the guide and Jesus
reached the Lassa temple in Tibet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Meng-ste opened wide
the temple doors, and all the priests
and masters gave a welcome to the
Hebrew sage.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus had access to all the
sacred manuscripts, and, with the
help of Meng-ste, read them all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Meng-ste often talked
with Jesus of the coming age, and
of the sacred service best adapted
to the people of the age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> In Lassa Jesus did not teach.
When he had finished all his studies
in the temple schools he journeyed
toward the West. In many villages
he tarried for a time and taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> At last he reached the pass,
and in the Ladak city, Leh, he was
received with favor by the monks,
the merchants, and the men of low
estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And in the monastery he
abode, and taught; and then he
sought the common people in the
marts of trade; and there he taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Not far away a woman lived,
whose infant son was sick nigh unto
death. The doctors had declared,
There is no hope; the child must die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The woman heard that Jesus
was a teacher sent from God, and
she believed that he had power to
heal her son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And so she clasped the dying
infant in her arms and ran with
haste and asked to see the man of
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> When Jesus saw her faith
he lifted up his eyes to heaven and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> My Father-God, let power divine
o&#8217;ershadow me, and let the
Holy Breath fill full this child that
it may live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And in the presence of the
multitude he laid his hand upon
the child and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Good woman you are blest;
your faith has saved your son.
And then the child was well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The people were astonished
and they said, This surely is the
Holy One made flesh, for man alone
cannot rebuke a fever thus and save
a child from death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then many of the people
brought their sick, and Jesus spoke
the Word, and they were healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Among the Ladaks Jesus
tarried many days; he taught them
how to heal; how sins are blotted
out, and how to make on earth a
heaven of joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The people loved him for his
words and works, and when he must
depart they grieved as children
grieve when mother goes away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And on the morning when
he started on his way the multitudes
were there to press his hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> To them he spoke a parable;
he said, A certain king so loved the
people of his land that he sent forth
his only son with precious gifts for
all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The son went everywhere
and scattered forth the gifts with
lavish hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But there were priests who
ministered at shrines of foreign gods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
who were not pleased because the
king did not through them bestow
the gifts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And so they sought to cause
the people all to hate the son. They
said, These gifts are not of any
worth; they are but counterfeits.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And so the people threw the
precious gems, and gold and silver
in the streets. They caught the
son and beat him, spit upon him,
drove him from their midst.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The son resented not their
insults and their cruelties; but thus
he prayed, My Father-God, forgive
these creatures of thy hand; they are
but slaves; they know not what
they do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And while they yet were
beating him he gave them food, and
blest them with a boundless love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> In certain cities was the son
received with joy, and he would
gladly have remained to bless the
homes; but he could tarry not, for
he must carry gifts to every one in
all the king&#8217;s domain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, My Father-God
is king of all mankind, and he
has sent me forth with all the bounties
of his matchless love and
boundless wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> To all the people of all lands,
lo, I must bear these gifts&mdash;this
water and this bread of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> I go my way, but we will
meet again; for in my Fatherland is
room for all; I will prepare a place
for you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And Jesus raised his hand in
silent benediction; then he went his
way.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_37">CHAPTER 37.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus is presented with a camel. He
goes to Lahore where he abides
with Ajainin, whom he teaches.
Lesson of the wandering musicians.
Jesus resumes his journey.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> caravan of merchantmen
were journeying through the
Kashmar vale as Jesus passed that
way, and they were going to Lahore,
a city of the Hand, the five-stream
land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The merchantmen had heard
the prophet speak, had seen his
mighty works in Leh, and they were
glad to see him once again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And when they knew that he
was going to Lahore and then across
the Sind, through Persia and the
farther West, and that he had no
beast on which to ride,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> They freely gave to him a noble
bactrian beast, well saddled and
equipped, and Jesus journeyed with
the caravan.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when he reached Lahore,
Ajainin and some other Brahmic
priests, received him with delight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Ajainin was the priest who
came to Jesus in the night time in
Benares many months before, and
heard his words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus was Ajainin&#8217;s
guest; he taught Ajainin many
things; revealed to him the secrets
of the healing art.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> He taught him how he could
control the spirits of the air, the fire,
the water and the earth; and he explained
to him the secret doctrine of
forgiveness, and the blotting out of
sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> One day Ajainin sat with
Jesus in the temple porch; a band of
wandering singers and musicians
paused before the court to sing and
play.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Their music was most rich
and delicate, and Jesus said, Among
the high-bred people of the land we
hear no sweeter music than that
these uncouth children of the wilderness
bring here to us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> From whence this talent and
this power? In one short life they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
surely could not gain such grace of
voice, such knowledge of the laws
of harmony and tone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Men call them prodigies.
There are no prodigies. All things
result from natural law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> These people are not young.
A thousand years would not suffice
to give them such divine expressiveness,
and such purity of voice and
touch.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Ten thousand years ago these
people mastered harmony. In days
of old they trod the busy thoroughfares
of life, and caught the melody
of birds, and played on harps of perfect
form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And they have come again
to learn still other lessons from the
varied notes of manifests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> These wandering people form
a part of heaven&#8217;s orchestra, and in
the land of perfect things the very
angels will delight to hear them
play and sing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus taught the common
people of Lahore; he healed
their sick, and showed to them the
way to rise to better things by helpfulness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> He said, We are not rich by
what we get and hold; the only
things we keep are those we give
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> If you would live the perfect
life, give forth your life in service
for your kind, and for the forms of
life that men esteem the lower forms
of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> But Jesus could not tarry
longer in Lahore; he bade the priests
and other friends farewell; and then
he took his camel and he went his
way toward the Sind.</p>

<i>Life and Works of Jesus in Persia.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_38">CHAPTER 38.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus crosses Persia. Teaches and
heals in many places. Three
magian priests meet him as he
nears Persepolis. Kaspar, and
two other Persian masters, meet
him in Persepolis. The seven masters
sit in silence seven days.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Four-and-twenty</span> years of
age was Jesus when he entered
Persia on his homeward way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> In many a hamlet, town and
neighborhood he paused a while
and taught and healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The priests and ruling classes
did not welcome him, because he
censured them for cruelty to those
of low estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The common people followed
him in throngs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> At times the chiefs made bold
to try to hinder him, forbidding him
to teach or heal the sick. But he regarded
not their angry threats; he
taught, and healed the sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> In time he reached Persepolis,
the city where the kings of Persia
were entombed; the city of the
learned magi, Hor, and Lun, and
Mer, the three wise men,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Who, two-and-twenty years
before, had seen the star of promise
rise above Jerusalem, and who had
journeyed to the West to find the
new-born king;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And were the first to honor
Jesus as the master of the age, and
gave him gifts of gold, gum-thus
and myrrh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> These magi knew, by ways
that masters always know, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Jesus neared Persepolis; and then
they girt themselves, and went to
meet him on the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And when they met, a light
much brighter than the light of day,
surrounded them, and men who
saw the four stand in the way declared
they were transfigured; seeming
more like gods than men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Now, Hor and Lun were
aged men, and Jesus placed them on
his beast to ride into Persepolis;
while he and Mer led on the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And when they reached the
magi&#8217;s home they all rejoiced. And
Jesus told the thrilling story of his
life, and Hor and Lun and Mer
spoke not; they only looked to
heaven, and in their hearts praised
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Three wise men from the
North were in Persepolis; and they
were Kaspar, Zara and Melzone;
and Kaspar was the wisest master
of the magian land. These three
were at the home of Hor and Lun
and Mer when Jesus came.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> For seven days these seven
men spoke not; they sat in silence
in the council hall in close communion
with the Silent Brotherhood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> They sought for light, for
revelation and for power. The
laws and precepts of the coming age
required all the wisdom of the masters
of the world.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_39">CHAPTER 39.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus attends a feast in Persepolis.
Speaks to the people, reviewing the
magian philosophy. Explains the
origin of evil. Spends the night in
prayer.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> feast in honor of the magian
God was being held, and many
men were gathered in Persepolis.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And on the great day of the
feast the ruling magian master said,
Within these sacred walls is liberty;
whoever wills to speak may speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus standing in the
midst of all the people, said, My
brothers, sisters, children of our Father-God:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Most blest are you among the
sons of men today, because you
have such just conceptions of the
Holy One and man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Your purity in worship and in
life is pleasing unto God; and to
your master, Zarathustra, praise is
due.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Well say you all, There is one
God from whose great being there
came forth the seven Spirits that
created heaven and earth; and manifest
unto the sons of men are these
great Spirits in the sun, and moon,
and stars.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> But in your sacred books we
read that two among these seven
are of superior strength; that one of
these created all the good; the other
one created all that evil is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> I pray you, honored masters,
tell me how that evil can be born of
that which is all good?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> A magus rose and said, If you
will answer me, your problem will
be solved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> We all do recognize the fact
that evil is. Whatever is, must
have a cause. If God, the One,
made not this evil, then, where is
the God who did?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Whatever
God, the One, has made is good, and
like the great first Cause, the seven
Spirits all are good, and everything
that comes from their creative
hands is good,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, all created things have
colors, tones and forms their own;
but certain tones, though good and
pure themselves, when mixed, produce
inharmonies, discordant tones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And certain things, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
good and pure, when mixed, produce
discordant things, yea, poisonous
things, that men call evil things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> So evil is the inharmonious
blending of the colors, tones, or
forms of good.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, man is not all-wise, and
yet has will his own. He has the
power, and he uses it, to mix God&#8217;s
good things in a multitude of ways,
and every day he makes discordant
sounds, and evil things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And every tone and form,
be it of good, or ill, becomes a living
thing, a demon, sprite, or spirit of
a good or vicious kind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Man makes his devil thus;
and then becomes afraid of him and
flees; his devil is emboldened, follows
him away and casts him into
torturing fires.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The devil and the burning
fires are both the works of man,
and none can put the fires out and
dissipate the evil one, but man who
made them both.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Then Jesus stood aside, and
not a magus answered him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And he departed from the
throng and went into a secret place
to pray.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_40">CHAPTER 40.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches the magians. Explains
the Silence and how to enter it.
Kaspar extols the wisdom of Jesus.
Jesus teaches in the groves of
Cyrus.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> in the early morning Jesus
came again to teach and heal.
A light not comprehended shown
about, as though some mighty spirit
overshadowed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A magus noted this and asked
him privately to tell from whence
his wisdom came, and what the
meaning of the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, There is a Silence
where the soul may meet its
God, and there the fount of wisdom
is, and all who enter are immersed
in light, and filled with wisdom, love
and power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The magus said, Tell me about
this Silence and this light, that I
may go and there abide.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, The Silence is
not circumscribed; is not a place
closed in with wall, or rocky steeps,
nor guarded by the sword of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Men carry with them all the
time the secret place where they
may meet their God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> It matters not where men
abide, on mountain top, in deepest
vale, in marts of trade, or in the
quiet home; they may at once, at
any time, fling wide the door, and
find the Silence, find the house of
God; it is within the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> One may not be so much disturbed
by noise of business, and the
words and thoughts of men if he
goes all alone into the valley or the
mountain pass.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when life&#8217;s heavy load is
pressing hard, it is far better to go
out and seek a quiet place to pray
and meditate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The Silence is the kingdom
of the soul which is not seen by human
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> When in the Silence, phantom
forms may flit before the mind;
but they are all subservient to the
will; the master soul may speak and
they are gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If you would find this Silence
of the soul you must yourself
prepare the way. None but the
pure in heart may enter here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And you must lay aside all
tenseness of the mind, all business
cares, all fears, all doubts and troubled
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Your human will must be absorbed
by the divine; then you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
come into a consciousness of holiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> You are within the Holy
Place, and you will see upon a living
shrine the candle of the Lord aflame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And when you see it burning
there, look deep within the temple
of your brain, and you will see it all
aglow.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> In every part, from head to
foot, are candles all in place, just
waiting to be lighted by the flaming
torch of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And when you see the candles
all aflame, just look, and you
will see, with eyes of soul, the waters
of the fount of wisdom rushing
on; and you may drink, and there
abide.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the curtains part,
and you are in the Holiest of All,
where rests the Ark of God, whose
covering is the Mercy Seat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Fear not to lift the sacred
board; the Tables of the Law are in
the Ark concealed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Take them and read them
well; for they contain all precepts
and commands that men will ever
need.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And in the Ark, the magic
wand of prophecy lies waiting for
your hand; it is the key to all the
hidden meanings of the present,
future, past.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then, behold, the manna
there, the hidden bread of life; and
he who eats shall never die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The cherubim have guarded
well for every soul this treasure box,
and whosoever will may enter in
and find his own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Now Kaspar heard the Hebrew
master speak and he exclaimed,
Behold, the wisdom of the
gods has come to men!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus went his way, and
in the sacred groves of Cyrus,
where the multitudes were met, he
taught and healed the sick.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_41">CHAPTER 41.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus stands by a healing fountain.
Reveals the fact that faith is the potent
factor in healing and many are
healed by faith. A little child
teaches a great lesson of faith.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> flowing spring that people
called the Healing Fount, was
near Persepolis.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And all the people thought
that at a certain time of year their
deity came down and gave a virtue
to the waters of the fount, and that
the sick who then would plunge into
the fount and wash would be made
whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> About the fount a multitude
of people were in waiting for the
Holy One to come and potentize the
waters of the fount.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The blind, the lame, the deaf,
the dumb, and those obsessed were
there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus, standing in the
midst of them, exclaimed, Behold
the spring of life! These waters
that will fail are honored as the special
blessing of your God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> From whence do healing virtues
come? Why is your God so
partial with his gifts? Why does
he bless this spring today, and then
tomorrow take his blessings all
away?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> A deity of power could fill
these waters full of healing virtue
every day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Hear me, you sick, disconsolate:
The virtue of this fount is not
a special gift of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Faith is the healing power of
every drop of all the waters of this
spring.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He who believes with all his
heart that he will be made whole by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
washing in this fount will be made
whole when he has washed; and he
may wash at any time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Let every one who has this
faith in God and in himself plunge
in these waters now and wash.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And many of the people
plunged into the crystal fount; and
they were healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then there was a rush,
for all the people were inspired with
faith, and each one strove to be
among the first to wash, lest all the
virtue be absorbed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus saw a little child,
weak, faint and helpless, sitting all
alone beyond the surging crowd;
and there was none to help her to
the fount.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, My little one,
why do you sit and wait? Why
not arise and hasten to the fount
and wash, and be made well?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The child replied, I need not
haste; the blessings of my Father in
the sky are measured not in tiny
cups; they never fail; their virtues
are the same forevermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> When these whose faith is
weak must haste to wash for fear
their faith will fail, have all been
cured, these waters will be just as
powerful for me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Then I can go and stay a
long, long time within the blessed
waters of the spring.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said, Behold a
master soul! She came to earth to
teach to men the power of faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then he lifted up the
child and said, Why wait for anything?
The very air we breathe is
filled with balm of life. Breathe in
this balm of life in faith and be
made whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The child breathed in the
balm of life in faith, and she was
well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The people marveled much
at what they heard and saw; they
said, This man must surely be the
god of health made flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, The fount
of life is not a little pool; it is as wide
as are the spaces of the heavens.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The waters of the fount are
love; the potency is faith, and he who
plunges deep into the living springs,
in living faith, may wash away his
guilt and be made whole, and freed
from sin.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> Persia Jesus&#8217; work was done
and he resumed his journey
towards his native land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The Persian sage went with
him to the Euphrates; then with a
pledge that they would meet again
in Egypt land the masters said,
Farewell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Kaspar went his way unto
his home beside the Caspian Sea;
and Jesus soon was in Chaldea, cradle
land of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> In Ur, where Abraham was
born, he tarried for a time; and
when he told the people who he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and why he came, they came from
near and far to speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He said to them, We all are
kin. Two thousand years and more
ago, our Father Abraham lived here
in Ur, and then he worshipped God
the One, and taught the people in
these sacred groves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And he was greatly blessed;
becoming father of the mighty hosts
of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Although so many years have
passed since Abraham and Sarah
walked these ways, a remnant of
their kindred still abide in Ur.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And in their hearts the God of
Abraham is still adored, and faith
and justice are the rocks on which
they build.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold this land! It is no
more the fruitful land that Abraham
loved so well; the rains come not as
in the former times; the vine is not
productive now, and withered are
the figs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> But this shall not forever be;
the time will come when all your
deserts will rejoice; when flowers
will bloom; when all your vines will
bend their heads with luscious fruit;
your shepherds will again be glad.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus preached to them
the gospel of good will, and peace on
earth. He told them of the brotherhood
of life, and of the inborn
powers of man, and of the kingdom
of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And as he spoke, Ashbina,
greatest sage of all Assyria, stood
before his face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The people knew the sage,
for he had often taught them in
their sacred halls and groves, and
they rejoiced to see his face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Ashbina said, My children
of Chaldea, hear! Behold, for you
are greatly blest today, because a
prophet of the living God has come
to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Take heed to what this master
says, for he gives forth the words

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and Ashbina visit Babylon and

days; then Jesus resumes his homeward

and aunt the story of his journeys.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> ruined Babylon was near,
and Jesus and the sage went
through her gates and walked
among her fallen palaces.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They trod the streets where
Israel once was held in base captivity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They saw where Judah&#8217;s sons
and daughters hung their harps
upon the willows, and refused to
sing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> They saw where Daniel and
the Hebrew children stood as living
witnesses of faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus lifted up his hands
and said, Behold the grandeur of
the works of man!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The king of Babylon destroyed
the temple of the Lord in
old Jerusalem; he burned the holy
city, bound in chains my people and
my kin, and brought them here as
slaves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> But retribution comes; for
whatsoever men shall do to other
men the righteous Judge will do to
them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The sun of Babylon has gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
down; the songs of pleasure will be
heard no more within her walls.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And every kind of creeping
thing and unclean bird will, in these
ruins, find their homes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And in the temple Belus,
Jesus and Ashbina stood in silent
thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Then Jesus spoke and said,
Behold this monument of folly and
of shame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Man tried to shake the very
throne of God, and he assayed to
build a tower to reach to heaven,
when, lo, his very speech was
snatched away, because in lofty
words he boasted of his power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And on these heights the
heathen Baal stood&mdash;the god
wrought out by hands of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Upon yon altar, birds, and
beasts, and men, yea children have
been burned in awful sacrifice to
Baal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But now the gory priests are
dead; the very rocks have shuddered
and have fallen down; the
place is desolate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Now, in the plains of Shinar
Jesus tarried yet for seven days,
and, with Ashbina, meditated long
upon the needs of men, and how the
sages could best serve the coming
age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Jesus went his way,
and after many days he crossed the
Jordan to his native land. At once
he sought his home in Nazareth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> His mother&#8217;s heart was filled
with joy; she made a feast for him,
inviting all her kindred and her
friends.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> But Jesus&#8217; brothers were not
pleased that such attention should
be paid to one they deemed a sheer
adventurer, and they went not in to
the feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They laughed their brother&#8217;s
claims to scorn; they called him indolent,
ambitious, vain; a worthless
fortune hunter; searcher of the
world for fame, who, after many
years returns to mother&#8217;s home
with neither gold, nor any other
wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus called aside his
mother and her sister, Miriam, and
told them of his journey to the East.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> He told them of the lessons
he had learned, and of the works
that he had done. To others he
told not the story of his life.</p>

<i>Life and Works of Jesus in Greece.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_44">CHAPTER 44.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus visits Greece and is welcomed
by the Athenians. Meets Apollo.
Addresses the Grecian masters in
the Amphitheater. The address.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Greek philosophy was full
of pungent truth, and Jesus
longed to study with the masters
in the schools of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And so he left his home in Nazareth
and crossed the Carmel hills,
and at the port took ship, and soon
was in the Grecian capital.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now, the Athenians had heard
of him as teacher and philosopher,
and they were glad to have him
come to them that they might hear
his words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Among the masters of the
Greeks was one, Apollo, who was
called, Defender of the Oracle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
recognized in many lands as Grecian
sage.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Apollo opened up for Jesus
all the doors of Grecian lore, and in
the Areopagus he heard the wisest
masters speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But Jesus brought to them a
wisdom greater far than theirs; and
so he taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Once in the Amphitheater he
stood, and when Apollo bade him
speak he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Athenian masters, hear! In
ages long ago, men, wise in nature&#8217;s
laws, sought out and found the place
on which your city stands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Full well you know that there
are parts of earth where its great
beating heart throws heavenward
etheric waves that meet the ethers
from above;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Where spirit-light and understanding,
like the stars of night,
shine forth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Of all the parts of earth there
is no place more sensitized, more
truly spirit-blest, than that where
Athens stands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Yea, all of Greece is blest.
No other land has been the homeland
of such mighty men of thought
as grace your scrolls of fame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> A host of sturdy giants of
philosophy, of poetry, of science,
and of art, were born upon the soil
of Greece, and rocked to manhood
in your cradle of pure thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> I come not here to speak of
science, of philosophy, or art; of
these you are the world&#8217;s best masters
now.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But all your high accomplishments
are but stepping stones
to worlds beyond the realm of
sense; are but illusive shadows flitting
on the walls of time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> But I would tell you of a life
beyond, within; a real life that can
not pass away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> In science and philosophy
there is no power strong enough to
fit a soul to recognize itself, or to
commune with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I would not stay the flow of
your great streams of thought; but
I would turn them to the channels
of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Unaided by the Spirit-breath,
the work of intellection tends to
solve the problems of the things we
see, and nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The senses were ordained to
bring into the mind mere pictures
of the things that pass away; they
do not deal with real things; they
do not comprehend eternal law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> But man has something in
his soul, a something that will tear
the veil apart that he may see the
world of real things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> We call this something, spirit
consciousness; it sleeps in every
soul, and cannot be awakened till
the Holy Breath becomes a welcome
guest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> This Holy Breath knocks at
the door of every soul, but cannot
enter in until the will of man
throws wide the door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> There is no power in intellect
to turn the key; philosophy
and science both have toiled to get
a glimpse behind the veil; but
they have failed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The secret spring that throws
ajar the door of soul is touched by
nothing else than purity in life, by
prayer and holy thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Return, O mystic stream of
Grecian thought, and mingle your
clear waters with the flood of Spirit-life;
and then the spirit consciousness
will sleep no more, and man
will know, and God will bless.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> When Jesus had thus said he
stepped aside. The Grecian masters
were astonished at the wisdom
of his words; they answered not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_45">CHAPTER 45.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches the Greek masters.
Goes with Apollo to Delphi and
hears the Oracle speak. It testifies
for him. He abides with Apollo,
and is recognized as the Living
Oracle of God. Explains to Apollo
the phenomenon of oracular speech.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">For</span> many days the Grecian
masters listened to the clear
incisive words that Jesus spoke, and
while they could not fully comprehend
the things he said, they were
delighted and accepted his philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One day as Jesus and Apollo
walked beside the sea, a Delphic
courier came in haste and said,
Apollo, master, come; the Oracle
would speak with you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Apollo said to Jesus, Sir, if
you would see the Delphic Oracle,
and hear it speak, you may accompany
me. And Jesus did accompany
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The masters went in haste;
and when they came to Delphi, great
excitement reigned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when Apollo stood before
the Oracle it spoke and said:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Apollo, sage of Greece, the
bell strikes twelve; the midnight of
the ages now has come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Within the womb of nature
ages are conceived; they gestate and
are born in glory with the rising
sun, and when the agic sun goes
down the age disintegrates and
dies.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The Delphic age has been an
age of glory and renown; the gods
have spoken to the sons of men
through oracles of wood, and gold,
and precious stone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The Delphic sun has set; the
Oracle will go into decline; the time
is near when men will hear its voice
no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The gods will speak to man
by man. The Living Oracle now
stands within these sacred groves;
the Logos from on high has come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> From henceforth will decrease
my wisdom and my power;
from henceforth will increase the
wisdom and the power of him, Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Let all the masters stay; let
every creature hear and honor him,
Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then the Oracle spoke
not again for forty days, and priests
and people were amazed. They
came from near and far to hear the
Living Oracle speak forth the wisdom
of the gods.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus and the Grecian
sage returned; and in Apollo&#8217;s home
the Living Oracle spoke forth for
forty days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> One day Apollo said to Jesus
as they sat alone, This sacred Delphic
Oracle has spoken many a helpful
word for Greece.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Pray tell me what it is that
speaks. Is it an angel, man, or living
god?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, It is not angel,
man, nor god that speaks. It is
the matchless wisdom of the master
minds of Greece, united in a master
mind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> This giant mind has taken
to itself the substances of soul, and
thinks, and hears, and speaks.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> It will remain a living soul
while master minds feed it with
thought, with wisdom and with
faith and hope.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> But when the master minds
of Greece shall perish from the land,
this giant master mind will cease to
be, and then the Delphic Oracle will
speak no more.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_46">CHAPTER 46.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A storm on the sea. Jesus rescues
many drowning men. The Athenians
pray to idols. Jesus rebukes
their idolatry and tells how God
helps. His last meeting with the
Greeks. Sails on the vessel Mars.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a holy day and Jesus
walked upon the Athens&#8217; beach.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A storm was on and ships
were being tossed about like toys
upon the bosom of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The sailors and the fishermen
were going down to watery graves;
the shores were strewn with bodies
of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus halted not, but
with a mighty power he rescued
many a helpless one, oft bringing
back to life the seeming dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Now, on these shores were
altars sacred to the gods supposed
to rule the seas.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And men and women, heedless
of the cries of drowning men,
were crowding all about these altars,
calling on their gods for help.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> At length the storm was done,
and all the sea was calm, and men
could think again; and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You worshippers of wooden
gods, how has the fury of this storm
been lessened by your frantic prayers?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Where is the strength of these
poor, weather-beaten gods with
painted swords and crowns?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A god that could abide in
such a little house could hardly
hold a frantic fly, and who could
hope that he could hold at bay the
Lords of winds and waves?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The mighty powers of
worlds unseen do not give forth
their help till men have done their
best; they only help when man can
do no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And you have agonized and
prayed around these shrines, and
let men sink to death who might
have been, by your assistance, saved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The God that saves dwells in
your souls, and manifests by making
use of your own feet, and legs,
and arms, and hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Strength never comes through
idleness; nor through a waiting for
another one to bear your loads, or
do the work that you are called to
do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But when you do your best
to bear your loads, and do your
work, you offer unto God a sacrifice
well-pleasing in his sight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And then the Holy One
breathes deep upon your glowing
sacrificial coals, and makes them
blaze aloft to fill your souls with
light, and strength and helpfulness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The most efficient prayer
that men can offer to a god of any
kind is helpfulness to those in need
of help; for what you do for other
men the Holy One will do for you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And thus God helps.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> His work in Greece was done,
and Jesus must go on his way to
Egypt in the South. Apollo, with
the highest masters of the land and
many people from the varied walks
of life, stood on the shore to see the
Hebrew sage depart; and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The son of man has been in
many lands; has stood in temples of
a multitude of foreign gods; has
preached the gospel of good will and
peace on earth to many people,
tribes and tongues;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Has been received with favor
in a multitude of homes; but Greece
is, of them all, the royal host.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The breadth of Grecian
thought; the depth of her philosophy;
the height of her unselfish aspirations
have well fitted her to be
the champion of the cause of human
liberty and right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">23</span> The fates of war have subjugated
Greece, because she trusted
in the strength of flesh, and bone
and intellect, forgetful of the spirit-life
that binds a nation to its source
of power,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But Greece will not forever
sit within the darkness of the shadowland
as vassal of a foreign king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Lift up your heads, you men
of Greece; the time will come when
Greece will breathe the ethers of the
Holy Breath, and be a main spring
of the spirit power of earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> But God must be your shield,
your buckler, and your tower of
strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then he said, Farewell.
Apollo raised his hand in silent
benediction, and the people wept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Upon the Cretan vessel, Mars,
the Hebrew sage sailed from the
Grecian port.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus with Elihu and Salome in
Egypt. Tells the story of his journeys.
Elihu and Salome praise
God. Jesus goes to the temple in
Heliopolis and is received as a pupil.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">And</span> Jesus came to Egypt land,
and all was well. He tarried
not upon the coast; he went at once
to Zoan, home of Elihu and Salome,
who five and twenty years before
had taught his mother in their sacred
school.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And there was joy when met
these three. When last the son of
Mary saw these sacred groves he
was a babe;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And now a man grown strong
by buffetings of every kind; a teacher
who had stirred the multitudes
in many lands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus told the aged
teachers all about his life; about his
journeyings in foreign lands; about
the meetings with the masters and
about his kind receptions by the
multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Elihu and Salome heard his
story with delight; they lifted up
their eyes to heaven and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Our Father-God, let now thy
servants go in peace, for we have
seen the glory of the Lord;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And we have talked with him,
the messenger of love, and of the
covenant of peace on earth, good
will to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Through him shall all the nations
of the earth be blest; through
him, Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus staid in Zoan many
days; and then went forth unto the
city of the sun, that men call Heliopolis,
and sought admission to the
temple of the sacred brotherhood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The council of the brotherhood
convened, and Jesus stood
before the hierophant; he answered
all the questions that were asked
with clearness and with power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The hierophant exclaimed,
Rabboni of the rabbinate, why
come you here? Your wisdom is
the wisdom of the gods; why seek
for wisdom in the halls of men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, In every
way of earth-life I would walk; in
every hall of learning I would sit;
the heights that any man has
gained, these I would gain;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> What any man has suffered
I would meet, that I may know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
griefs, the disappointments and the
sore temptations of my brother man;
that I may know just how to succor
those in need.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> I pray you, brothers, let me
go into your dismal crypts; and I
would pass the hardest of your tests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The master said, Take then
the vow of secret brotherhood. And
Jesus took the vow of secret brotherhood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Again the master spoke; he
said, The greatest heights are gained
by those who reach the greatest
depths; and you shall reach the
greatest depths.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The guide then led the way
and in the fountain Jesus bathed;
and when he had been clothed in
proper garb he stood again before
the hierophant.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_48">CHAPTER 48.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus receives from the hierophant
his mystic name and number.
Passes the first brotherhood test,
and receives his first degree, SINCERITY.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> master took down from the
wall a scroll on which was
written down the number and the
name of every attribute and character.
He said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The circle is the symbol of the
perfect man, and seven is the number
of the perfect man;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The Logos is the perfect word;
that which creates; that which destroys,
and that which saves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This Hebrew master is the
Logos of the Holy One, the Circle
of the human race, the Seven of
time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And in the record book the
scribe wrote down, The Logos-Circle-Seven;
and thus was Jesus
known.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The master said, The Logos
will give heed to what I say: No
man can enter into light till he has
found himself. Go forth and search
till you have found your soul and
then return.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The guide led Jesus to a room
in which the light was faint and
mellow, like the light of early dawn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The chamber walls were
marked with mystic signs, with
hieroglyphs and sacred texts; and
in this chamber Jesus found himself
alone where he remained for
many days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> He read the sacred texts;
thought out the meanings of the
hieroglyphs and sought the import
of the master&#8217;s charge to find
himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A revelation came; he got
acquainted with his soul; he found
himself; then he was not alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> One night he slept and at
the midnight hour, a door that he
had not observed, was opened, and
a priest in somber garb came in and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> My brother, pardon me for
coming in at this unseemly hour;
but I have come to save your life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> You are the victim of a cruel
plot. The priests of Heliopolis are
jealous of your fame, and they have
said that you shall never leave these
gloomy crypts alive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The higher priests do not go
forth to teach the world, and you
are doomed to temple servitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, if you would be free,
you must deceive these priests;
must tell them you are here to stay
for life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And then, when you have
gained all that you wish to gain, I
will return, and by a secret way will
lead you forth that you may go in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, My brother,
man, would you come here to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
deceit? Am I within these holy
walls to learn the wiles of vile hypocrisy?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Nay, man, my Father scorns
deceit, and I am here to do his will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Deceive these priests! Not
while the sun shall shine. What I
have said, that I have said; I will
be true to them, to God, and to
myself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then the tempter left,
and Jesus was again alone; but in a
little time a white-robed priest appeared
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Well done! the Logos has
prevailed. This is the trial chamber
of hypocrisy. And then he led
the way, and Jesus stood before the
judgment seat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And all the brothers stood;
the hierophant came forth and laid
his hand on Jesus&#8217; head, and placed
within his hands a scroll, on which
was written just one word, SINCERITY;
and not a word was said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The guide again appeared,
and led the way, and in a spacious
room replete with everything a
student craves was Jesus bade to
rest and wait.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_49">CHAPTER 49.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus passes the second brotherhood
test, and receives the second degree,
JUSTICE.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Logos did not care to rest;
he said, Why wait in this luxurious
room? I need not rest; my
Father&#8217;s work upon me presses
hard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> I would go on and learn my
lessons all. If there are trials, let
them come, for every victory over
self gives added strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And then the guide led on,
and in a chamber, dark as night,
was Jesus placed and left alone;
and days were spent in this deep
solitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus slept, and in the
dead of night a secret door was opened,
and, in priest&#8217;s attire, two
men came in; each carried in his
hand a little flickering lamp.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Approaching Jesus, one spoke
out and said, Young man, our
hearts are grieved because of what
you suffer in these fearful dens, and
we have come as friends to bring
you light, and show the way to liberty.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> We once, like you, were in
these dens confined, and thought
that through these weird, uncanny
ways we could attain to blessedness
and power;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> But in a luckful moment we
were undeceived, and, making use
of all our strength, we broke our
chains, and then we learned that
all this service is corruption in disguise.
These priests are criminals
just hid away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> They boast in sacrificial rites;
they offer to their gods, and burn
them while alive, poor birds, and
beasts; yea, children, women, men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And now they keep you here,
and, at a certain time, may offer
you in sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> We pray you, brother, break
your chains; come, go with us;
accept of freedom while you may.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Your little
tapers show the light you bring.
Pray, who are you? The words of
man are worth no more than is the
man himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> These temple walls are strong
and high; how gained you entrance
to this place?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The men replied, Beneath
these walls are many hidden ways,
and we who have been priests, spent
months and years within these dens,
know all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> Then you are traitors, Jesus
said. A traitor is a fiend; he who
betrays another man is never man
to trust.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> If one has only reached the
plane of treachery, he is a lover of
deceit, and will betray a friend to
serve his selfish self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold, you men, or whatsoe&#8217;er
you be, your words fall lightly
on my ears,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Could I prejudge these hundred
priests, turn traitor to myself
and them, because of what you say
when you confess your treachery?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> No man can judge for me;
and if I judge till testimony all is in
I might not judge aright.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Nay, men; by whatsoever
way you came, return. My soul
prefers the darkness of the grave
to little flickering lights like these
you bring.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> My conscience rules; what
these, my brothers, have to say I&#8217;ll
hear, and when the testimony all is
in I will decide. You cannot judge
for me, nor I for you,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Begone, you men, begone,
and leave me to this charming light;
for while the sun shines not, within
my soul there is a light surpassing
that of sun or moon.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Then, with an angry threat
that they would do him harm, the
wily tempters left, and Jesus was
again alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Again the white-robed priest
appeared, and led the way, and
Jesus stood again before the hierophant;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And not a word was said,
but in his hands the master placed
a scroll on which the word suggestive,
JUSTICE, was inscribed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Jesus was the master of
the phantom forms of prejudice and
of treachery.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_50">CHAPTER 50.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus passes the third brotherhood
test, and receives the third degree,
FAITH.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Logos waited seven days, and
then was taken to the Hall of
Fame, a chamber rich in furnishings,
and lighted up with gold and
silver lamps.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The colors of its ceilings, decorations,
furnishings and walls were
blue and gold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Its shelves were filled with
books of master minds; the paintings
and the statues were the works
of highest art.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus was entranced with
all this elegance and these manifests
of thought. He read the sacred
books, and sought the meanings of
the symbols and the hieroglyphs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when he was absorbed in
deepest thought, a priest approached
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Behold the glory of this place!
my brother you are highly blest.
Few men of earth, so young, have
reached such heights of fame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, if you do not waste your
life in search for hidden things that
men can never comprehend, you
may be founder of a school of
thought that will insure you endless
fame;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> For your philosophy is deeper
far than that of Plato, and your
teachings please the common people
more than those of Socrates.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Why seek for mystic light
within these antiquated dens? Go
forth and walk with men, and think
with men, and they will honor you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And, after all, these weird
initiations may be myths, and your
Messiah hopes but base illusions of
the hour.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> I would advise you to renounce
uncertain things and choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the course that leads to certain fame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And thus the priest, a demon
in disguise, sung syren songs of unbelief;
and Jesus meditated long
and well on what he said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The conflict was a bitter one,
for king Ambition is a sturdy foe to
fight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> For forty days the higher
wrestled with the lower self, and
then the fight was won.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Faith rose triumphant; unbelief
was not. Ambition covered
up his face and fled away, and Jesus
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The wealth, the honor, and
the fame of earth are but the baubles
of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> When this short span of
earthly life has all been measured
out, man&#8217;s bursting baubles will be
buried with his bones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Yea, what a man does for
his selfish self will make no markings
on the credit side of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The good that men for other
men shall do becomes a ladder
strong on which the soul may climb
to wealth, and power and fame of
God&#8217;s own kind, that cannot pass
away,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Give me the poverty of men,
the consciousness of duty done in
love, the approbation of my God,
and I will be content.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then he lifted up his
eyes to heaven and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> My Father-God, I thank thee
for this hour. I ask not for the glory
of thyself; I fain would be a keeper
of thy temple gates, and serve my
brother man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Again was Jesus called to
stand before the hierophant; again
no word was said, but in his hands
the master placed a scroll on which
was written FAITH.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus bowed his head in
humble thanks; then went his way.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_51">CHAPTER 51.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus passes the fourth brotherhood
test, and receives the fourth degree,
PHILANTHROPY.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">When</span> other certain days had
passed, the guide led Jesus
to the Hall of Mirth, a hall most
richly furnished, and replete with
every thing a carnal heart could
wish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The choicest viands and the
most delicious wines were on the
boards; and maids, in gay attire,
served all with grace and cheerfulness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And men and women, richly
clad, were there; and they were wild
with joy; they sipped from every
cup of mirth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus watched the happy
throng in silence for a time, and
then a man in garb of sage came up
and said, Most happy is the man
who, like the bee, can gather sweets
from every flower.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The wise man is the one who
seeks for pleasure, and can find it
everywhere,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> At best man&#8217;s span of life on
earth is short, and then he dies and
goes, he knows not where.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Then let us eat, and drink,
and dance, and sing, and get the
joys of life, for death comes on
apace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> It is but foolishness to spend
a life for other men. Behold, all
die and lie together in the grave,
where none can know and none can
show forth gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> But Jesus answered not; upon
the tinseled guests in all their
rounds of mirth he gazed in silent
thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then among the guests
he saw a man whose clothes were
coarse; who showed in face and
hands the lines of toil and want.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">11</span> The giddy throng found
pleasure in abusing him; they jostled
him against the wall, and
laughed at his discomfiture.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then a poor, frail woman
came, who carried in her face
and form the marks of sin and
shame; and without mercy she was
spit upon, and jeered, and driven
from the hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then a little child, with
timid ways and hungry mien, came
in and asked for just a morsel of
their food.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But she was driven out uncared
for and unloved; and still the
merry dance went on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And when the pleasure seekers
urged that Jesus join them in
their mirth, he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> How could I seek for pleasure
for myself while others are in
want? How can you think that
while the children cry for bread,
while those in haunts of sin call out
for sympathy and love that I can
fill myself to full with the good
things of life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> I tell you, nay; we all are
kin, each one a part of the great human
heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I cannot see myself apart
from that poor man that you so
scorned, and crowded to the wall;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Nor from the one in female
garb who came up from the haunts
of vice to ask for sympathy and love,
who was by you so ruthlessly pushed
back into her den of sin;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Nor from that little child
that you drove from your midst to
suffer in the cold, bleak winds of
night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I tell you, men, what you
have done to these, my kindred,
you have done to me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> You have insulted me in your
own home; I cannot stay. I will
go forth and find that child, that
woman and that man, and give
them help until my life&#8217;s blood all
has ebbed away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> I call it pleasure when I help
the helpless, feed the hungry, clothe
the naked, heal the sick, and speak
good words of cheer to those unloved,
discouraged and depressed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And this that you call mirth
is but a phantom of the night; but
flashes of the fire of passion, painting
pictures on the walls of time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And while the Logos spoke
the white-robed priest came in and
said to him, The council waits for
you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Then Jesus stood again before
the bar; again no word was
said; the hierophant placed in his
hands a scroll, on which was writ,
PHILANTHROPY.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus was a victor over
selfish self.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_52">CHAPTER 52.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus spends forty days in the temple
groves. Passes the fifth brotherhood
test and receives the fifth degree,
HEROISM.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> sacred temple groves were
rich in statues, monuments and
shrines; here Jesus loved to walk
and meditate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And after he had conquered
self he talked with nature in these
groves for forty days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And then the guide took
chains and bound him hand and
foot; and then cast him into a den
of hungry beasts, of unclean birds,
and creeping things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The den was dark as night;
the wild beasts howled; the birds
in fury screamed; the reptiles hissed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Who was it
that did bind me thus? Why did
I meekly sit to be bound down with
chains?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">6</span> I tell you, none has power to
bind a human soul. Of what are
fetters made?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And in his might he rose, and
what he thought were chains were
only worthless cords that parted
at his touch.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then he laughed and said,
The chains that bind men to the carcasses
of earth are forged in fancy&#8217;s
shop; are made of air, and welded
in illusion&#8217;s fires.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> If man will stand erect, and
use the power of will, his chains will
fall, like worthless rags; for will and
faith are stronger than the stoutest
chains that men have ever made.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus stood erect among
the hungry beasts, and birds, and
said, What is this darkness that
envelops me?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> &#8217;Tis but the absence of the
light. And what is light? &#8217;Tis
but the breath of God vibrating in
the rythm of rapid thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then he said, Let there
be light; and with a mighty will he
stirred the ethers up, and their vibrations
reached the plane of light;
and there was light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The darkness of that den of
night became the brightness of a
newborn day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then he looked to see
the beasts, and birds, and creeping
things; lo, they were not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, Of what are
souls afraid? Fear is the chariot
in which man rides to death;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And when he finds himself
within the chamber of the dead, he
learns that he has been deceived;
his chariot was a myth, and death
a fancy child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But some day all man&#8217;s lessons
will be learned, and from the
den of unclean, beasts and birds,
and creeping things he will arise to
walk in light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus saw a ladder made
of gold, on which he climbed, and
at the top the white-robed priest
awaited him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Again he stood before the
council bar; again no word was said;
again the hierophant reached forth
his hand to bless.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> He placed in Jesus&#8217; hand another
scroll, and on this one was
written, HEROISM.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The Logos had encountered
fear and all his phantom host, and
in the conflict he achieved the victory.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_53">CHAPTER 53.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus passes the sixth brotherhood
test and receives the sixth degree,
LOVE DIVINE.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> all the land there was no place
more grandly furnished than
the Beauty Parlors of the temple of
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Few students ever entered
these rich rooms; the priests regarded
them with awe, and called
them Halls of Mysteries.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> When Jesus had attained the
victory over fear, he gained the
right to enter here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The guide led on the way, and
after passing many richly furnished
rooms they reached the Hall of
Harmony; and here was Jesus left
alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Among the instruments of
music was a harpsichord, and Jesus
sat in thoughtful mood inspecting
it, when, quietly, a maiden of entrancing
beauty came into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> She did not seem to notice
Jesus as he sat and mused, so busy
with his thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> She found her place beside the
harpsichord; she touched the chords
most gently, and she sung the songs
of Israel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
8 And Jesus was entranced;
such beauty he had never seen;
such music he had never heard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The maiden sung her songs;
she did not seem to know that any
one was near; she went her way</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus, talking with himself,
said out, What is the meaning
of this incident? I did not know
that such entrancing beauty and
such queen-like loveliness were ever
found among the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> I did not know that voice of
angel ever graced a human form, or
that seraphic music ever came from
human lips.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> For days he sat entranced;
the current of his thoughts was
changed; he thought of nothing but
the singer and her songs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> He longed to see her once
again; and after certain days she
came; she spoke and laid her hand
upon his head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Her touch thrilled all his
soul, and for the time, forgotten was
the work that he was sent to do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Few were the words the
maiden said; she went her way; but
then the heart of Jesus had been
touched.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> A love-flame had been kindled
in his soul, and he was brought
to face the sorest trial of his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> He could not sleep nor eat.
Thoughts of the maiden came; they
would not go. His carnal nature
called aloud for her companionship.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then he said, Lo, I have
conquered every foe that I have
met, and shall I now be conquered
by this carnal love?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> My Father sent me here to
show the power of love divine, that
love that reaches every living thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Shall this pure, universal
love be all absorbed by carnal love?
Shall I forget all creatures else, and
lose my life in this fair maiden,
though she is the highest type of
beauty, purity and love?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Into its very depths his soul
was stirred, and long he wrestled
with this angel-idol of his heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> But when the day was almost
lost, his higher ego rose in might;
he found himself again, and then he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Although my heart shall
break I will not fail in this my hardest
task; I will be victor over carnal
love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And when again the maiden
came, and offered him her hand and
heart, he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Fair one, your very presence
thrills me with delight; your voice
is benediction to my soul; my human
self would fly with you, and be contented
in your love;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> But all the world is craving
for a love that I have come to manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> I must, then, bid you go;
but we will meet again; our ways
on earth will not be cast apart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> I see you in the hurrying
throngs of earth as minister of love;
I hear your voice in song, that wins
the hearts of men to better things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then in sorrow and in
tears the maiden went away, and
Jesus was again alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And instantly the great bells
of the temple rang; the singers sung
a new, new song; the grotto blazed
with light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The hierophant himself appeared,
and said, All hail! triumphant
Logos, hail! The conqueror
of carnal love stands on the
heights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then he placed in Jesus&#8217;
hands a scroll on which was written
LOVE DIVINE.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Together they passed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the grotto of the beautiful, and in

of life and death and of the
worlds beyond the circle of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> When he had finished all the
studies of the senior course, he went
into the Chamber of the Dead, that
he might learn the ancient methods
of preserving from decay the bodies

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And carriers brought the body

the weeping mother followed
close; her grief was great.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Good woman,
dry your tears; you follow but an

dead. Death is a cruel word; your
son can never die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> He had a task assigned to do

aside; he did not need it more.</p>

has another work to do, and he will
do it well, and then pass on to other
tasks, and, by and by, he will attain

and what he yet must do, we all
must do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, if you harbor grief,
and give your sorrows vent they
will grow greater every day. They
will absorb your very life until at
last you will be naught but grief,
wet down with bitter tears.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Instead of helping him you
grieve your son by your deep grief.
He seeks your solace now as he has
ever done; is glad when you are glad;
is saddened when you grieve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Go bury deep your woes, and
smile at grief, and lose yourself in
helping others dry their tears.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> With duty done comes happiness
and joy; and gladness cheers
the hearts of those who have passed
on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The weeping woman turned,
and went her way to find a happiness
in helpfulness; to bury deep
her sorrows in a ministry of joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Then other carriers came
and brought the body of a mother
to the Chamber of the Dead; and
just one mourner followed; she a

body needs no help from me;

they are unreal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Tears flow from hearts of
flesh; the spirit never weeps; and I
am longing for the day when I will
walk in light, where tears are wiped
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> My mother taught that all
emotions are the sprays that rise
from human loves, and hopes, and
fears; that perfect bliss cannot be
ours till we have conquered these.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And in the presence of that
child did Jesus bow his head in reverence.
He said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> For days and months and
years I&#8217;ve sought to learn this highest
truth that man can learn on
earth, and here a child, fresh
brought to earth, has told it all in
one short breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> No wonder David said, O
Lord, our Lord, how excellent is
thy name in all the earth!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Out of the mouths of babes
and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And then he laid his hand
upon the maiden&#8217;s head, and said,
I&#8217;m sure the blessings of my Father-God
will rest upon you, child, forevermore.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus passes the seventh brotherhood
test, and in the purple room of the
temple receives the seventh, the
highest degree, THE CHRIST.
He leaves the temple a conqueror.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> work of Jesus in the Chamber
of the Dead was done, and
in the temple purple room he stood
before the hierophant.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And he was clothed in purple
robes; and all the brothers stood.
The hierophant arose and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> This is a royal day for all the
hosts of Israel. In honor of their
chosen son we celebrate the great
Passover Feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And then he said to Jesus,
Brother, man, most excellent of
men, in all the temple tests you
have won out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Six times before the bar of
right you have been judged; six
times you have received the highest
honors man can give; and now you
stand prepared to take the last degree.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Upon your brow I place this
diadem, and in the Great Lodge of
the heavens and earth you are
THE CHRIST.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> This is your great Passover
rite. You are a neophyte no more;
but now a master mind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, man can do no more;
but God himself will speak, and will
confirm your title and degree.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Go on your way, for you must
preach the gospel of good will to
men and peace on earth; must open
up the prison doors and set the captives
free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And while the hierophant yet
spoke the temple bells rang out; a
pure white dove descended from
above and sat on Jesus&#8217; head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And then a voice that shook
the very temple said, THIS IS THE
CHRIST; and every living creature
said, AMEN.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The great doors of the temple
swung ajar; the Logos journeyed
on his way a conqueror.</p>

<i>The Council of the Seven Sages of the World.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_56">CHAPTER 56.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The seven sages of the world meet in
Alexandria. The purposes of the
meeting. The opening addresses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> every age since time began
have seven sages lived.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> At first of every age these
sages meet to note the course of
nations, peoples, tribes and tongues;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> To note how far toward justice,
love and righteousness the race
has gone;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> To formulate the code of laws,
religious postulates and plans of
rule best suited to the coming age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> An age had passed, and, lo,
another age had come; the sages
must convene.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Now, Alexandria was the center
of the world&#8217;s best thought, and
here in Philo&#8217;s home the sages met.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> From China came Meng-ste;
from India Vidyapati came; from
Persia Kaspar came; and from Assyria
Ashbina came; from Greece
Apollo came; Matheno was the
Egyptian sage, and Philo was the
chief of Hebrew thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The time was due; the council
met and sat in silence seven days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then Meng-ste arose and
said, The wheel of time has turned
once more; the race is on a higher
plane of thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The garments that our fathers
wove have given out; the
cherubim have woven a celestial
cloth; have placed it in our hands
and we must make for men new
garbs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The sons of men are looking
up for greater light. No longer do
they care for gods hewn out of
wood, or made of clay. They seek
a God not made with hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> They see the beams of coming
day, and yet they comprehend
them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The time is ripe, and we must
fashion well these garments for the
race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And let us make for men new
garbs of justice, mercy, righteousness
and love, that they may hide
their nakedness when shines the
light of coming day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Vidyapati said, Our
priests have all gone mad; they saw
a demon in the wilds and at him
cast their lamps and they are broken
up, and not a gleam of light has any
priest for men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The night is dark; the heart
of India calls for light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The priesthood cannot be
reformed; it is already dead; its
greatest needs are graves and funeral
chants.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The new age calls for liberty;
the kind that makes each man a
priest, enables him to go alone, and
lay his offerings on the shrine of
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Kaspar said, In Persia
people walk in fear; they do the
good for fear to do the wrong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The devil is the greatest
power in our land, and though a
myth, he dandles on his knee both
youth and age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Our land is dark, and evil
prospers in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Fear rides on every passing
breeze, and lurks in every form of
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The fear of evil is a myth, is
an illusion and a snare; but it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
live until some mighty power shall
come to raise the ethers to the plane
of light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> When this shall come to pass
the magian land will glory in the
light. The soul of Persia calls for
light.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_57">CHAPTER 57.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Meeting of the sages, continued.
Opening addresses. Jesus with
the sages. Seven days&#8217; silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Ashbina</span> said, Assyria is the
land of doubt; the chariot of
my people, that in which they
mostly ride, is labeled Doubt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Once Faith walked forth in
Babylon; and she was bright and
fair; but she was clothed in such
white robes that men became afraid
of her.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And every wheel began to
turn, and Doubt made war on her,
and drove her from the land; and
she came back no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> In form men worship God,
the One; in heart they are not sure
that God exists.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Faith worships at the shrine
of one not seen; but Doubt must see
her God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The greatest need of all Assyria
is faith&mdash;a faith that seasons
every thing that is, with certainty.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then Apollo said, The
greatest needs of Greece are true
concepts of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Theogony in Greece is rudderless,
for every thought may be a
god, and worshipped as a god.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The plane of thought is broad,
and full of sharp antagonists; and
so the circle of the gods is filled with
enmity, with wars and base intrigues.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Greece needs a master mind
to stand above the gods; to raise
the thoughts of men away from
many gods to God the One.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> We know that light is coming
o&#8217;er the hills. God speed the
light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Matheno said, Behold this
land of mystery! this Egypt of the
dead!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Our temples long have been
the tombs of all the hidden things
of time; our temples, crypts and
caves are dark.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> In light there are no secret
things. The sun reveals all hidden
truth. There are no mysteries in
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Behold the rising sun! His
beams are entering every door; yea,
every crevice of the mystic crypts
of Mizraim.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> We hail the light! All Egypt
craves the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Philo said, The need of
Hebrew thought and life is liberty.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The Hebrew prophets, seers,
and givers of the law, were men of
power, men of holy thought, and
they bequeathed to us a system of
philosophy that was ideal; one
strong enough and good enough to
lead our people to the goal of perfectness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> But carnal minds repudiated
holiness; a priesthood filled with
selfishness arose, and purity in
heart became a myth; the people
were enslaved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The priesthood is the curse
of Israel; but when he comes, who
is to come, he will proclaim emancipation
for the slaves; my people will
be free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Behold, for God has made
incarnate wisdom, love and light,
which he has called Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> To him is given the keys to
open up the dawn; and here, as
man, he walks with us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then the council chamber
door was opened and the Logos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
stood among the sages of the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Again the sages sat in silence
seven days.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_58">CHAPTER 58.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Meeting of the sages, continued.
Presentation of the seven universal
postulates.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when the sages were refreshed
they opened up the
Book of Life and read.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They read the story of the
life of man; of all his struggles,
losses, gains; and in the light of
past events and needs, they saw
what would be best for him in coming
years.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They knew the kind of laws
and precepts suited best to his estate;
they saw the highest God-ideal
that the race could comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Upon the seven postulates
these sages were to formulate, the
great philosophy of life and worship
of the coming age must rest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Now Meng-ste was the oldest
sage; he took the chair of chief, and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Man is not far enough advanced
to live by faith; he cannot
comprehend the things his eyes see
not,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> He yet is child, and during all
the coming age he must be taught
by pictures, symbols, rites, and
forms.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> His God must be a human
God; he cannot see a God by faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then he cannot rule himself;
the king must rule; the man
must serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The age that follows this will
be the age of man, the age of faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> In that blest age the human
race will see without the aid of carnal
eyes; will hear the soundless
sound; will know the Spirit-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The age we enter is the Preparation
age, and all the schools,
and governments and worship rites
must be designed in simple way
that men may comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And man cannot originate;
he builds by patterns that he sees;
so in this council we must carve out
pattern for the coming age.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And we must formulate the
gnosis of the Empire of the soul,
which rests on seven postulates.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Each sage in turn shall form
a postulate; and these shall be the
basis of the creeds of men until the
perfect age shall come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then Meng-ste wrote the
first:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> All things are thought; all
life is thought activity. The multitude
of beings are but phases of
the one great thought made manifest.
Lo, God is Thought, and
Thought is God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Then Vidyapati wrote the
second postulate:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Eternal Thought is one; in
essence it is two&mdash;Intelligence and
Force; and when they breathe a
child is born; this child is Love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And thus the Triune God
stands forth, whom men call Father-Mother-Child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> This Triune God is one; but
like the one of light, in essence he
is seven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And when the Triune God
breathes forth, lo, seven Spirits
stand before his face; these are creative
attributes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Men call them lesser gods,
and in their image they made man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Kaspar wrote the third:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Man was a thought of God,
formed in the image of the Septonate,
clothed in the substances of
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And his desires were strong;
he sought to manifest on every plane
of life, and for himself he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
body of the ethers of the earthy
forms, and so descended to the
plane of earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> In this descent he lost his
birthright; lost his harmony with
God, and made discordant all the
notes of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Inharmony and evil are the
same; so evil is the handiwork of
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Ashbina wrote the fourth:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Seeds do not germinate in
light; they do not grow until they
find the soil, and hide themselves
away from light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Man was evolved a seed of
everlasting life; but in the ethers of
the Triune God the light was far too
great for seeds to grow;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And so man sought the soil
of carnal life, and in the darksomeness
of earth he found a place
where he could germinate and grow.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The seed has taken root and
grown full well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The tree of human life is rising
from the soil of earthy things,
and, under natural law, is reaching
up to perfect form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> There are no supernatural
acts of God to lift a man from carnal
life to spirit blessedness; he grows
as grows the plant, and in due time
is perfected.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> The quality of soul that
makes it possible for man to rise to
spirit life is purity.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_59">CHAPTER 59.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Meeting of the sages, continued. The
remaining postulates. The sages
bless Jesus. Seven days&#8217; silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Apollo</span> wrote the fifth:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The soul is drawn to perfect
light by four white steeds, and
these are Will, and Faith, and
Helpfulness and Love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> That which one wills to do, he
has the power to do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> A knowledge of that power is
faith; and when faith moves, the
soul begins its flight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> A selfish faith leads not to
light. There is no lonely pilgrim
on the way to light. Men only gain
the heights by helping others gain
the heights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The steed that leads the way
to spirit life is Love; is pure unselfish
Love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Matheno wrote the sixth:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The universal Love of which
Apollo speaks is child of Wisdom
and of Will divine, and God has
sent it forth to earth in flesh that
man may know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The universal Love of which
the sages speak, is Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The greatest mystery of all
times lies in the way that Christ
lives in the heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Christ cannot live in clammy
dens of carnal things. The seven
battles must be fought, the seven
victories won before the carnal
things, like fear, and self, emotions
and desire, are put away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> When this is done the Christ
will take possession of the soul; the
work is done, and man and God are
one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Philo wrote the seventh:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> A perfect man! To bring
before the Triune God a being such
as this was nature made.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> This consummation is the
highest revelation of the mystery
of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> When all the essences of carnal
things have been transmuted
into soul, and all the essences of
soul have been returned to Holy
Breath, and man is made a perfect
God, the drama of Creation will
conclude. And this is all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And all the sages said, Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">18</span> Then Meng-ste said, The
Holy One has sent to us a man illumined
by the efforts of unnumbered
years, to lead the thoughts of
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> This man, approved by all
the master minds of heaven and
earth, this man from Galilee, this
Jesus, chief of all the sages of the
world, we gladly recognize.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> In recognition of this wisdom
that he brings to men, we
crown him with the Lotus wreath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> We send him forth with all
the blessing of the seven sages of

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Then all the sages laid their
hands on Jesus&#8217; head, and said with
one accord, Praise God!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> For wisdom, honor, glory,
power, riches, blessing, strength, are
yours, O Christ, forever more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And every living creature
said, Amen.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And then the sages sat in

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus addresses the seven sages. The
address. Jesus goes to Galilee.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> seven days of silence
passed and Jesus, sitting with
the sages said:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The history of life is well condensed
in these immortal postulates.
These are the seven hills on which
the holy city shall be built.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> These are the seven sure foundation
stones on which the Universal
Church shall stand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> In taking up the work assigned
for me to do I am full conscious
of the perils of the way; the
cup will be a bitter one to drink and
human nature well might shrink.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> But I have lost my will in that
of Holy Breath, and so I go my way
to speak and act as I am moved to
speak and act by Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The words I speak are not my
own; they are the words of him
whose will I do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Man is not far enough advanced
in sacred thought to comprehend
the Universal Church, and so
the work that God has given me to
do is not the building of that Church.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> I am a model maker, sent to
make a pattern of the Church that
is to be&mdash;a pattern that the age
may comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> My task as model builder lies
within my native land, and there,
upon the postulate that Love is son
of God, that I am come to manifest
that Love, the Model Church will
stand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And from the men of low estate
I will select twelve men, who
represent the twelve immortal
thoughts; and these will be the
Model Church.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The house of Judah, my own
kindred in the flesh, will comprehend
but little of my mission to the
world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And they will spurn me,
scorn my work, accuse me falsely,
bind me, take me to the judgment
seat of carnal men who will convict
and slay me on the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But men can never slay the
truth; though banished it will come
again in greater power; for truth
will subjugate the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The Model Church will live.
Though carnal man will prostitute
its sacred laws, symbolic rites and
forms, for selfish ends, and make it
but an outward show, the few will
find through it the kingdom of the
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And when the better age
shall come the Universal Church
will stand upon the seven postulates,
and will be built according
to the pattern given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>

<p class="hang"><i>John, the harbinger, returns to Hebron.
Lives as a hermit in the
wilds. Visits Jerusalem and
speaks to the people.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> came to pass when John, the
son of Zacharias and Elizabeth,
had finished all his studies in the
Egyptian schools that he returned
to Hebron, where he abode for certain
days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then he sought the wilderness
and made his home in David&#8217;s
cave where many years before,
he was instructed by the Egyptian
sage.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Some people called him Hermit
of Engedi; and others said, He
is the Wild Man of the hills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He clothed himself with skins
of beasts; his food was carobs,
honey, nuts and fruits.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When John was thirty years

in the market place he sat in silence
seven days.</p>

came out in multitudes to see the
silent hermit of the hills; but none
were bold enough to ask him who

done he stood forth in the midst of
all and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Behold, the king has come;
the prophets told of him; the wise
men long have looked for him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Prepare, O Israel, prepare to
meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And that was all he said,
and then he disappeared, and no
one knew where he had gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And there was great unrest
through all Jerusalem. The rulers
heard the story of the hermit of the
hills,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And they sent couriers forth
to talk with him that they might
know about the coming king; but
they could find him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And after certain days he
came again into the market place,
and all the city came to hear him
speak; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Be not disturbed, you rulers
of the state; the coming king is no
antagonist; he seeks no place on
any earthly throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> He comes the Prince of
Peace, the king of righteousness
and love; his kingdom is within
the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The eyes of men shall see it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
not and none can enter but the pure
in heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Prepare, O Israel, prepare to
meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Again the hermit disappeared;
the people strove to follow him,
but he had drawn a veil about his
form and men could see him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> A Jewish feast day came;
Jerusalem was filled with Jews and
proselytes from every part of Palestine,
and John stood in the temple
court and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Prepare, O Israel, prepare to
meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Lo, you have lived in sin;
the poor cry in your streets, and
you regard them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Your neighbors, who are
they? You have defrauded friend
and foe alike.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> You worship God with voice
and lip; your hearts are far away,
and set on gold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Your priests have bound
upon the people burdens far too
great to bear; they live in ease upon
the hard earned wages of the poor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Your lawyers, doctors, scribes
are useless cumberers of the ground;
they are but tumors on the body of
the state;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> They toil not neither do
they spin, yet they consume the
profits of your marts of trade.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Your rulers are adulterers,
extortioners and thieves, regarding
not the rights of any man;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And robbers ply their calling
in the sacred halls; the holy temple
you have sold to thieves; their dens
are in the sacred places set apart for
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Hear! hear! you people of
Jerusalem! Reform; turn from your
evil ways or God will turn from you,
and heathen from afar will come,
and what is left of all your honor
and your fame will pass in one short
hour.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Prepare, Jerusalem, prepare
to meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> He said no more; he left the
court and no one saw him go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The priests, the doctors and
the scribes were all in rage. They
sought for John intent to do him
harm. They found him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The common people stood in
his defense; they said, The hermit
speaks the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And then the priests, the doctors
and the scribes were sore afraid;
they said no more; they hid themselves
away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>John, the harbinger, again visits
Jerusalem. Speaks to the people.
Promises to meet them at Gilgal in
seven days. Goes to Bethany and
attends a feast.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day John went again into
the temple courts and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Prepare, O Israel, prepare to
meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The chief priests and the
scribes would know the meaning of
his words; they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Bold man, what is the purport
of this message that you bring to
Israel? If you be seer and prophet,
tell us plainly who has sent you
here?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And John replied, I am the
voice of one who cries out in the wilderness,
Prepare the way, make
straight the paths, for, lo, the Prince
of Peace will come to rule in love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Your prophet Malachi wrote
down the words of God:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And I will send Elijah unto
you before the retribution day shall
come, to turn again the hearts of
men to God and if they will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
turn, lo, I will smite them with a
curse.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You men of Israel; you know
your sins. As I passed by I saw a
wounded bird prone in your streets,
and men of every class were beating
it with clubs; and then I saw that
Justice was its name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> I looked again and saw that
its companion had been killed; the
pure white wings of Righteousness
were trampled in the dust.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> I tell you men, your awfulness
of guilt has made a cesspool of
iniquity that sends a fearful stench
to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Reform, O Israel, reform;
prepare to meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then John turned away
and as he went he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> In seven days, lo, I will stand
at Gilgal, by the Jordan ford, where
Israel first crossed into the promised
land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then he left the temple
court to enter it no more; but many
people followed him as far as Bethany,
and there he tarried at the
home of Lazarus, his kin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The anxious people gathered
all about the home and would not
go; then John came forth and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Reform, O Israel, reform;
prepare to meet your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The sins of Israel do not all
lie at the door of priest and scribe.
O think you not that all the sinners
of Judea are found among the rulers
and the men of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> It is no sign that man is good
and pure because he lives in want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The listless, shiftless vagabonds
of earth are mostly poor and
have to beg for bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I saw the very men that
cheered because I told the priests
and scribes of their injustice unto
man, throw stones and beat poor
Justice in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I saw them trample on the
poor dead bird of Righteousness;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And you who follow after
me, you commoners, are not one
whit behind the scribes and priests
in crime.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Reform, you men of Israel;
the king has come; prepare to meet
your king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> With Lazarus and his sisters,
John remained for certain days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> In honor of the Nazarite a
feast was spread, and all the people
stood about the board.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And when the chief men of
the town poured out the sparkling
wine and offered John a cup, he took
it, held it high in air, and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Wine makes glad the carnal
heart, and it makes sad the human
soul; it plunges deep in bitterness
and gall the deathless spirit of the
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> I took the vow of Nazar
when a child, and not a drop has
ever passed my lips.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And if you would make glad
the coming king, then shun the cup
as you would shun a deadly thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And then he threw the
sparkling wine out in the street.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>John, the harbinger, visits Jericho.

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">And</span> John went down to Jericho;
there he abode with Alpheus.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And when the people heard
that he was there they came in
throngs to hear him speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> He spoke to none; but when
the time was due he went down to
the Jordan ford, and to the multitudes
he said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">4</span> Reform and in the fount of
purity wash all your sins away; the
kingdom is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Come unto me and in the waters
of this stream be washed, symbolic
of the inner cleansing of the
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And, lo, the multitudes came
down and in the Jordan they were
washed, and every man confessed
his sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> For many months, in all the
regions round about, John plead for
purity and righteousness; and after
many days he went again to Bethany;
and there he taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> At first few but the honest
seekers came; but, by and by, the
selfish and the vicious came with no
contrition; came because the many
came.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when John saw the unrepentant
Pharisees and Sadducees
come unto him, he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> You children of the vipers,
stay; are you disturbed by news of
coming wrath?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Go to, and do the things that
prove repentance genuine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Is it enough for you to say
that you are heirs of Abraham? I
tell you, no.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The heirs of Abraham are
just as wicked in the sight of God
when they do wrong as any heathen
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Behold the ax! and every
tree that bears not wholesome fruit
is cut down at the roots and cast
into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then the people asked,
What must we do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And John replied, Accept the
ministry of helpfulness for all mankind;
spend not upon your selfish
selves all that you have.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Let him who has two coats
give one to him who has no coat;
give part of all the food you have
to those in need.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And when the publicans
came up and asked, What must we
do? John answered them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Be honest in your work; do
not increase for selfish gain the
tribute you collect; take nothing
more than what your king demands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And when the soldiers came
and asked, What must we do? The
harbinger replied,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Do violence to none; exact
no wrongful thing, and be contented
with the wages you receive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Among the Jews were many
who had been waiting for the Christ
to come, and they regarded John
as Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But to their questions John
replied, In water I do cleanse, symbolic
of the cleansing of the soul;
but when he comes who is to come,
lo, he will cleanse in Holy Breath
and purify in fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> His fan is in his hand, and he
will separate the wheat and chaff;
will throw the chaff away, but garner
every grain of wheat. This is
the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Behold he comes! and he will
walk with you, and you will know
him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> He is the king; the latchet of
his shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And John left Bethany and
went again unto the Jordan ford.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_64">CHAPTER 64.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus comes from Galilee, and is baptized
by John. The Holy Breath
testifies of his messiahship.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> news reached Galilee, and
Jesus with the multitude went
down to where the harbinger was
preaching at the ford.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> When Jesus saw the harbinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
he said, Behold the man of God!
Behold the greatest of the seers!
Behold, Elijah has returned!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Behold the messenger whom
God has sent to open up the way!
The kingdom is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> When John saw Jesus standing
with the throng he said, Behold the
king who cometh in the name of
God!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said to John, I
would be washed in water as a symbol
of the cleansing of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And John replied, You do not
need to wash, for you are pure in
thought, and word, and deed. And
if you need to wash I am not worthy
to perform the rite.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus said, I come to be
a pattern for the sons of men, and
what I bid them do, that I must do;
and all men must be washed, symbolic
of the cleansing of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> This washing we establish as
a rite&mdash;baptism rite we call it now,
and so it shall be called.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Your work, prophetic harbinger,
is to prepare the way, and
to reveal the hidden things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The multitudes are ready for
the words of life, and I have come
to be made known by you to all the
world, as prophet of the Triune
God, and as the chosen one to manifest
the Christ to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Then John led Jesus down
into the river at the ford and he
baptized him in the sacred name of
him who sent him forth to manifest
the Christ to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And as they came out of the
stream, the Holy Breath, in form of
dove, came down and sat on Jesus&#8217;
head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> A voice from heaven said,
This is the well-beloved son of God,
the Christ, the love of God made
manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> John heard the voice, and
understood the message of the voice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now Jesus went his way,
and John preached to the multitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> As many as confessed their
sins, and turned from evil ways to
ways of right, the harbinger baptized,
symbolic of the blotting out
of sins by righteousness.</p>

<i>The Christine Ministry of Jesus&mdash;Introductory Epoch.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_65">CHAPTER 65.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus goes to the wilderness for self-examination,
where he remains
forty days. Is subjected to three
temptations. He overcomes. Returns
to the camps of John and begins
teaching.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> harbinger had paved the
way; the Logos had been introduced
to men as love made
manifest, and he must now begin
his Christine ministry.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And he went forth into the
wilderness to be alone with God
that he might look into his inner
heart, and note its strength and
worthiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And with himself he talked;
he said, My lower self is strong; by
many ties I am bound down to carnal
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Have I the strength to overcome
and give my life a willing sacrifice
for men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When I shall stand before the
face of men, and they demand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
proof of my messiahship, what will
I say?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then the tempter came
and said, If you be son of God,
command these stones to turn to
bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus said, Who is it that
demands a test? It is no sign that
one is son of God because he does a
miracle; the devils can do mighty
things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Did not the black magicians
do great things before the Pharaohs?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> My words and deeds in all the
walks of life shall be the proof of my
messiahship.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then the tempter said,
If you will go into Jerusalem, and
from the temple pinnacle cast down
yourself to earth, the people will believe
that you are the Messiah sent
from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> This you can surely do; for
did not David say, He gives his angels
charge concerning you, and
with their hands will they uphold
lest you should fall?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, I may not
tempt the Lord, my God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then the tempter said,
Look forth upon the world; behold
its honors and its fame! Behold its
pleasures and its wealth!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> If you will give your life for
these they shall be yours.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But Jesus said, Away from
me all tempting thoughts. My
heart is fixed; I spurn this carnal
self with all its vain ambition and its
pride.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> For forty days did Jesus
wrestle with his carnal self; his
higher self prevailed. He then was
hungry, but his friends had found
him and they ministered to him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Jesus left the wilderness,
and in the consciousness of
Holy Breath, he came unto the
camps of John and taught.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_66">CHAPTER 66.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Six of John&#8217;s disciples follow Jesus
and become his disciples. He
teaches them. They sit in the
Silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the followers of John
were many men from Galilee.
The most devout were Andrew,
Simon, James, and John, with Philip
and his brother of Bethsaida.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> One day as Andrew, Philip
and a son of Zebedee, were talking
with the harbinger, the Logos came,
and John exclaimed, Behold the
Christ!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And then the three disciples
followed Jesus, and he asked, What
do you seek?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And the disciples asked,
Where do you live? And Jesus
answered, Come and see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Andrew called his brother
Simon, saying, Come with me, for
I have found the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> When Jesus looked in Simon&#8217;s
face he said, Behold a rock! and
Peter is your name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Philip found Nathaniel
sitting by a tree, and said, My
brother, come with me, for I have
found the Christ! In Nazareth he
abides.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Nathaniel said, Can anything
of good come out of Nazareth? And
Philip answered, Come and see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> When Jesus saw Nathaniel
come he said, Behold an Israelite
indeed in whom there is no guile!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Nathaniel said, How can you
speak about me thus?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, I saw you as
you sat beneath the fig tree over
there, before your brother called.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Nathaniel lifted up his hands
and said, This surely is the Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the king, for whom the harbinger
has often testified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And John went forth and
found his brother James, and
brought him to the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The six disciples went with
Jesus to the place where he abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Peter said, We long
have sought for Christ. We came
from Galilee to John; we thought
that he was Christ, but he confessed
to us that he was not;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> That he was but the harbinger
sent forth to clear the way, and
make the pathway easy for the
coming king; and when you came
he said, Behold the Christ!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And we would gladly follow
where you go. Lord, tell us what
to do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus said, The foxes of
the earth have homes, the birds
have nests; I have no place to lay
my head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> He who would follow me
must give up all the cravings of the
self and lose his life in saving life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I come to save the lost, and
man is saved when he is rescued
from himself. But men are slow
to comprehend this doctrine of the
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Peter said, I cannot
speak for any other man, but for
myself I speak: I will leave all and
follow where you lead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And then the others spoke
and said, You have the words of
truth; you came from God, and if
we follow in your footsteps we cannot
miss the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Then Jesus and the six disciples
sat a long, long time in silent
thought.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_67">CHAPTER 67.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus visits John at the Jordan. Delivers
his first Christine address
to the people. The address. He
goes with his disciples to Bethany.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> on the morrow Jesus came
again and stood with John
beside the ford; and John prevailed
on him to speak, and standing forth
he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> You men of Israel, hear! The
kingdom is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Behold the great key-keeper
of the age stands in your midst; and
with the spirit of Elijah he has
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Behold, for he has turned the
key; the mighty gates fly wide and
all who will may greet the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Behold these multitudes of
women, children, men! they throng
the avenues, they crowd the outer
courts; each seems to be intent to
be the first to meet the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Behold, the censor comes and
calls, Whoever will may come; but
he who comes must will to prune
himself of every evil thought;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Must overcome desire to gratify
the lower self; must give his life
to save the lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The nearer to the kingdom
gate you come, more spacious is the
room; the multitudes have gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> If men could come unto the
kingdom with their carnal thoughts,
their passions and desires, there
scarcely would be room for all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> But when they cannot take
these through the narrow gate they
turn away; the few are ready to go
in and see the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Behold, John is a mighty
fisher, fishing for the souls of men.
He throws his great net out into
the sea of human life; he draws it in
and it is full.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But what a medley catch!
a catch of crabs, and lobsters, sharks
and creeping things, with now and
then a fish of better kind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Behold, the thousands come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
to hear the Wild Man of the hills;
they come in crowds that he may
wash them in the crystal flood, and
with their lips they do confess their
sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But when the morrow comes
we find them in their haunts of vice
again, reviling John, and cursing
God, and heaping insults on the
king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And blessed are the strong in
heart, for they shall not be cast
about by every wind that blows;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But while the fickle and the
thoughtless have gone back to
Egypt land for leeks and carnal
herbs to satisfy their appetites, the
pure in heart have found the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But even those whose faith
is weak, and who are naught but
carnal manifests, will some day
come again, and enter in with joy
to see the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> O men of Israel, take heed
to what this prophet has to say! Be
strong in mind; be pure in heart;
be vigilant in helpfulness; the kingdom
is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> When Jesus had thus said
he went his way, and with his six
disciples came to Bethany; and
they abode with Lazarus many
days.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_68">CHAPTER 68.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus speaks to the people in Bethany.
Tells them how to become pure in
heart. Goes to Jerusalem and in
the temple reads from a prophetic
book. Goes to Nazareth.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> news soon spread abroad
that Jesus, king of Israel, had
come to Bethany, and all the people
of the town came forth to greet
the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus, standing in the
midst of them exclaimed, Behold,
indeed, the king has come, but
Jesus is not king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The kingdom truly is at hand;
but men can see it not with carnal
eyes; they cannot see the king upon
the throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This is the kingdom of the
soul; its throne is not an earthly
throne; its king is not a man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When human kings found
kingdoms here, they conquer other
kings by force of arms; one kingdom
rises on the ruins of another one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But when our Father-God
sets up the kingdom of the soul, he
pours his blessings forth, like rain,
upon the thrones of earthly kings
who rule in righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> It is not rule that God would
overthrow; his sword is raised
against injustice, wantonness and
crime.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, while the kings of Rome
do justice, and love mercy and walk
humbly with their God, the benediction
of the Triune God will rest
upon them all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They need not fear a messenger
whom God sends forth to earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> I am not sent to sit upon a
throne to rule as Cæsar rules; and
you may tell the ruler of the Jews
that I am not a claimant for his
throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Men call me Christ, and God
has recognized the name; but Christ
is not a man. The Christ is universal
love, and Love is king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> This Jesus is but man who
has been fitted by temptations overcome,
by trials multiform, to be the
temple through which Christ can
manifest to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Then hear, you men of Israel,
hear! Look not upon the flesh; it
is not king. Look to the Christ
within, who shall be formed in every
one of you, as he is formed in me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> When you have purified
your hearts by faith, the king will
enter in, and you will see his face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then the people asked,
What must we do that we may
make our bodies fit abiding places
for the king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Whatever
tends to purity in thought, and
word, and deed will cleanse the
temple of the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> There are no rules that can
apply to all, for men are specialists
in sin; each has his own besetting
sin,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And each must study for
himself how he can best transmute
his tendency to evil things to that
of righteousness and love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Until men reach the higher
plane, and get away from selfishness,
this rule will give the best results:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Do unto other men what you
would have them do to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And many of the people said,
We know that Jesus is the Christ,
the king who was to come, and
blessed be his name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Now, Jesus and his six disciples
turned their faces toward
Jerusalem, and many people followed
them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But Mathew, son of Alpheus,
ran on before, and when he reached
Jerusalem, he said, Behold the
Christines come! The multitudes
came forth to see the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But Jesus did not speak to
any one until he reached the temple
court, and then he opened up a book
and read:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Behold, I send my messenger,
and he will pave the way, and
Christ, for whom you wait, will
come unto his temple unannounced.
Behold, for he will come, says God,
the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then he closed the book;
he said no more; he left the temple
halls, and with his six disciples,
went his way to Nazareth,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And they abode with Mary,
Jesus&#8217; mother, and her sister, Miriam.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day as Peter walked
about in Nazareth, he met
the ruler of the synagogue who
asked, Who is this Jesus lately
come to Nazareth?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Peter said, This Jesus is
the Christ of whom our prophets
wrote; he is the king of Israel. His
mother, Mary, lives on Marmion

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The ruler said, Tell him to
come up to the synagogue, for I
would hear his plea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Peter ran and told to
Jesus what the ruler said; but Jesus
answered not; he went not to the
synagogue.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Then in the evening time the
ruler came up Marmion Way, and in
the home of Mary found he Jesus
and his mother all alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And when the ruler asked for
proof of his messiahship, and why
he went not to the synagogue when
he was bidden, Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> I am not slave to any man; I
am not called unto this ministry by
priest. It is not mine to answer
when men call. I come the Christ
of God; I answer unto God alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Who gave you right to ask for
proof of my messiahship? My proof
lies in my words and works, and so
if you will follow me you will not
lack for proof.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then the ruler went his
way; he asked himself, What manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of a man is this to disregard the
ruler of the synagogue?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The people of the town came
out in throngs to see the Christ, and
hear him speak; but Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> A prophet has no honor in his
native town, among his kin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> I will not speak in Nazareth
until the words I speak, and works
I do in other towns have won the
faith of men,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Until men know that God
has christed me to manifest eternal
love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Good will to you, my kin; I
bless you with a boundless love,
and I bespeak for you abundant joy
and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> He said no more, and all the
people marveled much because he
would not speak in Nazareth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> Cana, Galilee, there was a marriage
feast, and Mary and her
sister Miriam, and Jesus and his six
disciples were among the guests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The ruler of the feast had
heard that Jesus was a master sent
from God, and he requested him to
speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, There is no tie
more sacred than the marriage tie.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The chain that binds two
souls in love is made in heaven, and
man can never sever it in twain,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The lower passions of the
twain may cause a union of the
twain, a union as when oil and water
meet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then a priest may forge
a chain, and bind the twain. This
is not marriage genuine; it is a
counterfeit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The twain are guilty of adultery;
the priest is party to the
crime. And that was all that Jesus
said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> As Jesus stood apart in silent
thought his mother came and said
to him, The wine has failed; what
shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, Pray what is
wine? It is but water with the
flavoring of grapes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And what are grapes? They
are but certain kinds of thought
made manifest, and I can manifest
that thought, and water will be
wine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He called the servants, and
he said to them, Bring in six water
pots of stone, a pot for each of these,
my followers, and fill them up with
water to the brims,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The servants brought the
water pots, and filled them to their
brims.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Jesus with a mighty
thought stirred up the ethers till
they reached the manifest, and, lo,
the water blushed, and turned to
wine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The servants took the wine
and gave it to the ruler of the feast
who called the bridegroom in and
said to him,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> This wine is best of all; most
people when they give a feast bring
in the best wine at the first; but,
lo, you have reserved the best until
the last.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And when the ruler and the
guests were told that Jesus, by the
power of thought, had turned the
water into wine, they were amazed;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> They said, This man is more
than man; he surely is the christed

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> city of Capernaum was by

Andrew, John and James were near,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The news spread through the

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus in Jerusalem. Drives the merchants
out of the temple. The
priests resent, and he defends himself
from the standpoint of a loyal
Jew. He speaks to the people.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Jewish paschal feast time
came and Jesus left his mother
in Capernaum and journeyed to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And he abode with one a Sadducee,
whose name was Jude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And when he reached the temple
courts the multitudes were there
to see the prophet whom the people
thought had come to break the yoke
of Rome, restore the kingdom of the
Jews, and rule on David&#8217;s throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And when the people saw him
come they said, All hail! behold
the king!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> But Jesus answered not; he
saw the money changers in the house
of God, and he was grieved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The courts had been converted
into marts of trade, and men
were selling lambs and doves for
offerings in sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus called the priests
and said, Behold, for paltry gain
you have sold out the temple of the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> This house ordained for prayer
is now a den of thieves. Can good
and evil dwell together in the courts
of God? I tell you, no.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then he made a scourge
of cords and drove the merchants
out; he overturned their boards, and
threw their money on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He opened up the cages of
the captive birds, and cut the cords
that bound the lambs, and set them
free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The priests and scribes
rushed out, and would have done
him harm, but they were driven
back; the common people stood in
his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then the rulers said,
Who is this Jesus you call king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The people said, He is the
Christ of whom our prophets wrote;
he is the king who will deliver
Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The rulers said to Jesus, Man,
if you be king, or Christ, then show
us signs. Who gave you right to
drive these merchants out?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, There is no
loyal Jew who would not give his
life to save this temple from disgrace;
in this I acted simply as a
loyal Jew, and you yourselves will
bear me witness to this truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The signs of my messiahship
will follow me in words and deeds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And you may tear the temple
down (and you will tear it down)
and in three days it will be built
again more glorious than before.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Now Jesus meant that they
might take his life; tear down his
body, temple of the Holy Breath,
and he would rise again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The Jews knew not the meaning
of his words; they laughed his
claims to scorn. They said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> A multitude of men were
forty and six years in building up
this house, and this young stranger
claims that he will build it up in
three score hours; his words are
idle, and his claims are naught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then they took the
scourge with which he drove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
merchants out, and would have
driven him away; but Philo, who
had come from Egypt to attend the
feast, stood forth and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> You men of Israel, hear!
This man is more than man; take
heed to what you do. I have, myself,
heard Jesus speak, and all the
winds were still.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And I have seen him touch
the sick, and they were healed. He
stands a sage above the sages of the
world;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And you will see his star
arise, and it will grow until it is the
full-orbed Sun of Righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Do not be hasty, men; just
wait and you will have the proofs of
his messiahship.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then the priests laid
down the scourge, and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Prepare, O Israel, prepare to
meet your king! But you can never
see the king while you press sin as
such a precious idol to your hearts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The king is God; the pure in
heart alone can see the face of God
and live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then the priests cried
out, This fellow claims to be the
God. Is not this sacrilege! away
with him!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> But Jesus said, No man has
ever heard me say, I am a king.
Our Father-God is king. With every
loyal Jew I worship God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> I am the candle of the Lord
aflame to light the way; and while
you have the light walk in the light.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus again visits the temple, and is
favorably received by the people.
Tells the parable of a king and his
sons. Defines messiahship.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day the multitudes were
surging through the temple
courts, intent on hearing Jesus
speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And when he came the people
said, All hail! behold the king!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus spoke a parable; he
said, A king had vast domains; his
people all were kin, and lived in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Now, after many years the
king said to his people, Take these
lands and all I have; enhance their
values; rule yourselves, and live in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And then the people formed
their states; selected governors and
petty kings.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But pride, ambition, selfish
greed, and base ingratitude grew
fast, and kings began to war.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> They wrote in all their statute
books that might is right; and
then the strong destroyed the weak,
and chaos reigned through all the
vast domain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> A long time passed, and then
the king looked out on his domain.
He saw his people in their cruel
wars; he saw them sick and sore distressed;
he saw the strong enslave
the weak,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then he said, What shall
I do? Shall I send forth a scourge?
shall I destroy my people all?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then his heart was
stirred with pity and he said, I will
not send a scourge; I will send forth
my only son, heir to the throne, to
teach the people love, and peace,
and righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He sent his son; the people
scorned him and maltreated him,
and nailed him to a cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> He was entombed; but death
was far too weak to hold the prince,
and he arose.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> He took a form man could
not kill; and then he went again to
teach the people love, and peace and
righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> And thus God deals with
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> A lawyer came and asked,
What does messiah mean? and who
has right to make messiah of a man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Messiah is
one sent from God to seek and save
the lost. Messiahs are not made
by men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> In first of every age Messiah
comes to light the way; to heal up
broken hearts; to set the prisoners
free. Messiah and the Christ are
one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Because a man claims to be
Christ is not a sign that he is Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> A man may cause the
streams to flow from flinty rocks;
may bring on storms at will; may
stay tempestuous winds; may heal
the sick and raise the dead, and not
be sent from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> All nature is subservient to
the will of man, and evil men, as
well as good, have all the powers of
mind, and may control the elements.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The head gives not the proof
of true messiahship, for man by
means of intellect, can never know
of God, nor bring himself to walk in
light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Messiah lives not in the head,
but in the heart, the seat of mercy
and of love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Messiah never works for selfish
gains; he stands above the carnal
self; his words and deeds are
for the universal good.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Messiah never tries to be a
king, to wear a crown and sit upon
an earthly throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The king is earthy, of the
earth; Messiah is the man from
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then the lawyer asked,
Why do you pose as king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, No man has
ever heard me say that I am king.
I could not sit in Cæsar&#8217;s place and
be the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Give unto Cæsar what belongs
to him; give unto God the
treasures of your heart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the Sabbath day, and
Jesus stood among the surging

Jesus spoke the Word, and they

to go and wash in certain pools; and
others he anointed with a holy oil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> A doctor asked him why he

was the Sabbath day designed to fit
the man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> If you had fallen in a pit and,
lo, the Sabbath day had come, and
I should pass your way, would you
cry out,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Let me alone; it is a sin to
help me on the Sabbath day; I&#8217;ll
swelter in this filth until another

you know you would be glad

curse the man of God because he
heeded not their words.</p>

had fallen in, and it was drowned,
and friends were bearing it away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But Jesus called the carriers
to stop; and then he stretched himself
upon the lifeless form, and
breathed into its mouth the breath
of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then he called aloud
unto the soul that had gone out,
and it returned; the child revived
and lived.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus saw a wounded
dog; it could not move; it lay beside
the way and groaned with pain.
He took it in his arms and bore it
to the home where he abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> He poured the healing oil
into the wounds; he cared for it as
though it were a child till it was
strong and well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus saw a little boy
who had no home, and he was hungry;
when he called for bread the
people turned away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus took the child and
gave him bread; he wrapped him in
his own warm coat, and found for
him a home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> To those who followed him
the master said, If man would gain
again his lost estate he must respect
the brotherhood of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Whoever is not kind to
every form of life&mdash;to man, to beast,
to bird, and creeping thing&mdash;cannot
expect the blessings of the Holy
One; for as we give, so God will give
to us.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nicodemus visits Jesus in the night.

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Nicodemus</span> was a ruler of the
Jews, and he was earnest,
learned and devout.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> He saw the master&#8217;s signet in
the face of Jesus as he talked, but
was not brave enough to publicly
confess his faith in him;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> So in the night he went to talk
with Jesus at the home of Jude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> When Jesus saw him come he
said, Full blessed are the pure in

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Twice blessed are the fearless,

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Nicodemus said, Hail,

alone could never teach as you have
taught; could never do the works
that you have done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, Except a man

king; he cannot comprehend the

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Nicodemus said, How
can a man be born again? Can he
go back into the womb and come
again to life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said, The birth of
which I speak is not the birth of
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Except a man be born of
water and the Holy Breath, he cannot
come into the kingdom of the

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> That which is born of flesh is

Holy Breath is child of God.</p>

please; men hear their voices, and
may note results; but they know
not from whence they come, nor
where they go; and so is every one
that is born of Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The ruler said, I do not understand;
pray tell me plainly what
you mean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, The kingdom
of the Holy One is in the soul;
men cannot see it with their carnal
eyes; with all their reasoning powers
they comprehend it not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> It is a life deep hid in God;
its recognition is the work of inner
consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The kingdoms of the world
are kingdoms of the sight; the kingdom
of the Holy One is that of faith;
its king is love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Men cannot see the love of
God unmanifest, and so our Father-God
has clothed this love with flesh&mdash;flesh
of a son of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And that the world may see
and know this love made manifest,
the son of man must needs be lifted
up.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> As Moses in the wilderness
raised up the serpent for the healing
of the flesh, the son of man must be
raised up.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> That all men bitten by the
serpent of the dust, the serpent of
this carnal life, may live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> He who believes in him shall
have eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> For God so loved the world
that he sent forth his only son to be
raised up that men may see the love
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> God did not send his son to
judge the world; he sent him forth
to save the world; to bring men to
the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But men love not the light,
for light reveals their wickedness;
men love the dark.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Now, every one who loves
the truth comes to the light; he does
not fear to have his works made
manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The light had come, and Nicodemus
went his way; he knew the
meaning of the birth of Holy
Breath; he felt the presence of the
Spirit in his soul.</p>

for many days and taught

forth in battle everywhere. He had
no sword; no armor of defence; no

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The hosts of Egypt quailed
before this sturdy king of right;
the kings of Egypt placed their
crowns upon his head,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And gave into his hands the
scepter of all Egypt land, and not a
drop of blood was shed, and not a
captive placed in chains;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But everywhere the conqueror
threw wide the prison doors

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And, once again, the Prince

carnal mind that breeds this enmity
and hate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> While I was born a Jew I
recognize the brotherhood of life.
Samaritans are just as dear to me
as Jew or Greek.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then had you but known
the blessings that our Father-God
has sent to men by me, you would
have asked me for a drink,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And I would glad have
given you a cup of water from the
Fount of Life, and you would never
thirst again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The woman said, This well
is deep, and you have naught with
which to draw; how could you get
the water that you speak about?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, The water
that I speak about comes not from
Jacob&#8217;s well; it flows from springs
that never fail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Lo, every one who drinks
from Jacob&#8217;s well will thirst again;
but they who drink the water that
I give will never thirst again;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> For they themselves become
a well, and from their inner parts
the sparkling waters bubble up into
eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The woman said, Sir, I would
drink from that rich well of life.
Give me to drink, that I may thirst
no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Go call your
husband from the town that he may
share with you this living cup.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The woman said, I have no
husband, sir.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus answered her and
said, You scarcely know what husband
means; you seem to be a
gilded butterfly that flits from
flower to flower,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">19</span> To you there is no sacredness
in marriage ties, and you affinitize
with any man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And you have lived with five
of them who were esteemed as husbands
by your friends.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The woman said, Do I not
speak unto a prophet and a seer?
Will you not condescend to tell me
who you are?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, I need not
tell you who I am for you have read
the Law, the Prophets and the
Psalms that tell of me,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> I am one come to break away
the wall that separates the sons of
men. In Holy Breath there is no
Greek, nor Jew, and no Samaritan;
no bond, nor free; for all are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The woman asked, Why do
you say that only in Jerusalem men
ought to pray, and that they should
not worship in our holy mount?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Jesus said, What you
have said, I do not say. One place
is just as sacred as another place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The hour has come when men
must worship God within the temple
of the heart; for God is not within
Jerusalem, nor in your holy mount
in any way that he is not in every
heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Our God is Spirit; they who
worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The woman said, We know
that when Messiah comes that he
will lead us in the ways of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Jesus said, Behold the
Christ has come; Messiah speaks to
you.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">While</span> Jesus yet was talking

with the food.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And when they saw him talking

one they thought a courtesan, they
were amazed; yet no one asked him
why he spoke with her.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The woman was so lost in
thought and so intent on what the
master said, that she forgot her
errand to the well; she left her pitcher
and ran quickly to the town.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> She told the people all about
the prophet she had met at Jacob&#8217;s

thing I ever did.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when the people would
know more about the man, the
woman said, Come out and see.
And multitudes went out to Jacob&#8217;s

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> When Jesus saw them come
he said to those who followed him,
You need not say, It is four months
before the harvest time;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Behold, the harvest time is
now. Lift up your eyes and look;
the fields are golden with the ripened
grain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Lo, many sowers have gone
forth to sow the seeds of life; the
seed has grown; the plants have
strengthened in the summer sun;
the grain has ripened, and the master
calls for men to reap.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And you shall go out in the
fields and reap what other men have
sown; but when the reckoning day
shall come the sowers and the
reapers all together will rejoice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Philip said to Jesus,
Stay now your work a time and sit

faint for you have eaten naught

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But Jesus said, I am not
faint, for I have food to eat you
know not of.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Then the disciples said
among themselves, Who could have
brought him aught to eat?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> They did not know that he
had power to turn the very ethers
into bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, The master
of the harvest never sends his reapers
forth and feeds them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> My Father who has sent me
forth into the harvest field of human
life will never suffer me to want;
and when he calls for you to serve,
lo, he will give you food, will clothe
and shelter you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then turning to the people
of Samaria, he said, Think not it
strange that I, a Jew, should speak
to you, for I am one with you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The universal Christ who
was, and is, and evermore shall be,
is manifest in me; but Christ belongs
to every man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> God scatters forth his blessings
with a lavish hand, and he is
not more kind to one than to another
one of all the creatures of
his hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> I just came up from Judah&#8217;s
hills, and God&#8217;s same sun was shining
and his flowers were blooming,
and in the night his stars were just
as bright as they are here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> God cannot cast a child away;
the Jew, the Greek and the Samaritan
are equal in his sight.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And why should men and
women fret and quarrel, like children
in their plays?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The lines that separate the
sons of men are made of straw, and
just a single breath of love would
blow them all away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The people were amazed at
what the stranger said, and many
said, The Christ that was to come
has surely come.</p>

with the priests went to the market

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And then he closed the book

a voice of soul spoke to his soul imploring
help.</p>

sick nigh unto death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> She could not speak, but she

God, and in her heart she called on
him for help.</p>

and they said to her, How were you
healed? And she replied,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I do not know; I simply
asked the man of God in thought
for healing power, and in a moment
I was well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The people said, The gods
have surely come to earth; for man
has not the power to heal by
thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> But Jesus said, The greatest
power in heaven and earth is
thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> God made the universe by
thought; he paints the lily and the
rose with thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Why think it strange that
I should send a healing thought
and change the ethers of disease
and death to those of health and
life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Lo, you shall see far greater
things than this, for by the power
of holy thought, my body will be
changed from carnal flesh to spirit
form; and so will yours.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> When Jesus had thus said
he disappeared, and no one saw
him go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> His own disciples did not
comprehend the change; they knew
not where their master went, and
they went on their way.</p>

must be proclaimed in all the
world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> This Christine vine will be a
mighty vine whose branches will
comprise the peoples, tribes and
tongues of all the earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> I am the vine; twelve men
shall be the branches of the stock,
and these shall send forth branches
everywhere;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And from among the people
who have followed me, the Holy
Breath will call the twelve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Go now and do your work as
you have done your work; but listen
for the call.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Then the disciples went unto
their daily tasks, to do their work as
they had done, and Jesus went alone
into the Hammoth hills to pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Three days and nights he
spent communing with the Silent
Brotherhood; then, in the power of
Holy Breath he came to call the
twelve.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus walks by the sea. Stands in a
fishing boat and speaks to the people.
Under his direction the fishermen
secure a great catch of fish.
He selects and calls his twelve apostles.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Beside</span> the sea of Galilee the
Christine master walked, and
multitudes of people followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The fishing boats had just
come in, and Peter and his brother
waited in their boats; their helpers
were ashore repairing broken nets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus went into a boat
and Peter pushed it out a little ways
from shore; and Jesus standing in
the boat spoke to the multitude.
He said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Isaiah, prophet of the Lord
of hosts, looked forward and he saw
this day; he saw the people standing
by the sea, and he exclaimed,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The land of Zebulon and Napthali,
land beyond the Jordan and
toward the sea, the Gentile Galilee,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The people were in darkness,
knowing not the way; but, lo, they
saw the Day Star rise; a light
streamed forth; they saw the way of
life; they walked therein.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And you are blest beyond all
people of the earth today, because
you first may see the light, and may
become the children of the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Then Jesus said to Peter,
Bring your nets aboard, and put out
in the deep,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Peter did as Jesus bade
him do; but in a faithless way he
said, This is a useless trip; there are
no fish upon this shore of Galilee
today; with Andrew I have toiled
all night, and taken naught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> But Jesus saw beneath the
surface of the sea; he saw a multitude
of fish. He said to Peter,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Cast out your net upon the
right side of the boat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Peter did as Jesus said,
and, lo, the net was filled; it scarce
was strong enough to hold the multitude
of fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Peter called to John and
James, who were near by, for help;
and when the net was hauled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
boat, both boats were well nigh
filled with fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> When Peter saw the heavy
catch, he was ashamed of what he
said; ashamed because he had no
faith, and he fell down at Jesus&#8217;
feet and said, Lord, I believe!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, Behold the
catch! from henceforth you shall
fish no more for fish;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> You shall cast forth the
Christine net into the sea of human
life, upon the right side of the boat;
you shall ensnare the multitudes
to holiness and blessedness and
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Now, when they reached the
shore the Christine master called to
Peter, Andrew, James and John and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> You fishermen of Galilee, the
masters have a mighty work for us
to do; I go, and you may follow me.
And they left all and followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus walked along the
shore, and seeing Philip and Nathaniel
walking on the beach he said to
them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> You teachers of Bethsaida,
who long have taught the people
Greek philosophy, the masters have
a higher work for you and me to do;
I go and you may follow me; and
then they followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> A little farther on there stood
a Roman tribute house, and Jesus
saw the officer in charge; his name
was Matthew, who once abode in
Jericho;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The youth who once ran on
before the Lord into Jerusalem and
said, Behold the Christines come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Matthew was a man of
wealth, and learned in wisdom of
the Jews, the Syrians and the
Greeks.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus said to him, Hail,
Matthew, trusted servant of the
Cæsars, hail! the masters call us to
the tribute house of souls; I go and
you may follow me. And Matthew
followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Ischariot and his son, whose
name was Judas, were employed by
Matthew and were at the tribute
house.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said to Judas,
Stay your work; the masters call us
to a duty in the savings bank of
souls; I go and you may follow me.
And Judas followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus met a lawyer who
had heard about the Christine master
and had come from Antioch to
study in the school of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> This man was Thomas, man
of doubt, and yet a Greek philosopher
of culture and of power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But Jesus saw in him the
lines of faith, and said to him, The
masters have a need of men who
can interpret law; I go, and you
may follow me. And Thomas followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And when the evening came
and Jesus was at home, behold, there
came his kindred, James and Jude,
the sons of Alpheus and Miriam.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And these were men of faith,
and they were carpenters of Nazareth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Jesus said to them, Behold,
for you have toiled with me,
and with my father Joseph, building
houses for the homes of men. The
masters call us now to aid in building
homes for souls; homes built
without the sound of hammer, ax,
or saw;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> I go, and you may follow me.
And James and Jude exclaimed,
Lord, we will follow you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And on the morrow Jesus
sent a message unto Simon, leader
of the Zelotes, a strict exponent of
the Jewish law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And in the message Jesus
said, The masters call for men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
demonstrate the faith of Abraham;
I go, and you may follow me. And
Simon followed him.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_89">CHAPTER 89.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The twelve apostles are at Jesus&#8217;
home and are consecrated to their
work. Jesus instructs them. He
goes to the synagogue on the Sabbath
and teaches. He casts an unclean
spirit out of one obsessed. He
heals Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> on the day before the Sabbath
day, the twelve disciples
who had received the call were met
with one accord in Jesus&#8217; home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus said to them, This
is the day to consecrate yourselves
unto the work of God; so let us
pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Turn from the outer to the
inner self; close all the doors of carnal
self and wait.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The Holy Breath will fill this
place, and you will be baptized in
Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And then they prayed; a light
more brilliant than the noonday
sun filled all the room, and tongues
of flame from every head rose high
in air.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The atmosphere of Galilee was
set astir; a sound like distant thunder
rolled above Capernaum, and
men heard songs, as though ten
thousand angels joined in full accord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then the twelve disciples
heard a voice, a still, small voice,
and just one word was said, a word
they dared not speak; it was the
sacred name of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said to them, By
this omnific Word you may control
the elements, and all the powers of
air.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when within your souls
you speak this Word, you have the
keys of life and death; of things that
are; of things that were; of things
that are to be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Behold you are the twelve
great branches of the Christine
vine; the twelve foundation stones;
the twelve apostles of the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> As lambs I send you forth
among wild beasts; but the omnific
Word will be your buckler and your
shield.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then again the air was
filled with song, and every living
creature seemed to say, Praise God!
Amen!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The next day was the Sabbath
day; and Jesus went with his
disciples to the synagogue, and
there he taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The people said, He teaches
not as do the scribes and Pharisees;
but as a man who knows, and has
authority to speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> As Jesus spoke, a man obsessed
came in; the evil spirits that
obsessed the man were of the baser
sort; they often threw their victim
to the ground, or in the fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And when the spirits saw
the Christine master in the synagogue
they knew him, and they
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> You son of God, why are you
here? would you destroy us by the
Word before our time? we would
have naught to do with you; let us
alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But Jesus said to them, By
the omnific Word I speak; Come
out; torment this man no more;
go to your place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the unclean spirits
threw the man upon the floor, and,
with a fiendish cry, they went
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus lifted up the man
and said to him, If you will keep
your mind full occupied with good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
the evil spirits cannot find a place
to stay;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> They only come to empty
heads and hearts. Go on your way
and sin no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The people were astonished
at the words that Jesus spoke, the
work he did. They asked among
themselves,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Who is this man? From
whence comes all this power that
even unclean spirits fear, and flee
away?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The Christine master left the
synagogue; with Peter, Andrew,
James and John, he went to Peter&#8217;s
house where one, a near of kin, was
sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Peter&#8217;s wife came in;
it was her mother who was sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus touched the woman
as she lay upon her couch; he
spoke the Word; the fever ceased
and she arose and ministered to
them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The neighbors heard what
had occurred, and then they brought
their sick, and those obsessed, and
Jesus laid his hands on them, and
they were healed.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_90">CHAPTER 90.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus goes alone to a mountain to
pray. His disciples find him. He
calls the twelve and they journey
through Galilee teaching and healing.
At Tiberius Jesus heals a
leper. The Christines return to
Capernaum. In his own home
Jesus heals a palsied man and
makes known the philosophy of
healing and the forgiveness of sins.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christine master disappeared;
no one saw him go, and
Peter, James and John set forth to
search for him; they found him at
his trysting-place out on the Hammoth
hills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Peter said, The city of
Capernaum is wild; the people crowd
the streets and every public place is
filled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The men, the women and the
children everywhere are asking for
the man who heals by will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Your home and our homes
are filled with people who are sick;
they call for Jesus who is called the
Christ. What will we say to them?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, A score of
other cities call, and we must take
the bread of life to them. Go call
the other men and let us go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus and the twelve
went to Bethsaida where Philip and
Nathaniel dwelt; and there they
taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The multitudes believed on
Christ, confessed their sins and were
baptized, and came into the kingdom
of the Holy One.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The Christine master and the
twelve went everywhere through
all the towns of Galilee, and taught,
baptizing all who came in faith, and
who confessed their sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They opened blinded eyes,
unstopped deaf ears, drove forth the
evil ones from those obsessed, and
healed disease of every kind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And they were in Tiberius by
the sea, and as they taught a leper
came a-near and said, Lord, I believe,
and if you will but speak the
Word I will be clean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said to him, I will;
be clean. And soon the leprosy
was gone; the man was clean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus charged the man,
Say naught to any one, but go and
show yourself unto the priests and
offer for your cleansing what the
law demands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The man was wild with joy;
but then he went not to the priests,
but in the marts of trade, and everywhere
he told what had been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> And then the sick in throngs
pressed hard upon the healer and
the twelve, imploring to be healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And they were so importunate
that little could be done, and
so the Christines left the crowded
thoroughfares, and went to desert
places where they taught the multitudes
that followed them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Now, after many days the
Christines came back to Capernaum.
When it was noised around
that Jesus was at home, the people
came; they filled the house till there
was no more room, not even at the
door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And there were present
scribes and Pharisees and doctors of
the law from every part of Galilee,
and from Jerusalem, and Jesus
opened up for them the way of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Four men brought one, a
palsied man upon a cot, and when
they could not pass the door they
took the sick man to the roof, and
opened up a way, then let him down
before the healer&#8217;s face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> When Jesus saw their faith,
he said unto the palsied man, My
son, be of good cheer; your sins are
all forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And when the scribes and
Pharisees heard what he said, they
said, Why does this man speak
thus? who can forgive the sins of
men but God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus caught their
thought; he knew they questioned
thus among themselves; he said to
them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Why reason thus among
yourselves? What matters it if I
should say, Your sins are blotted
out; or say, Arise, take up your bed
and walk?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But just to prove that men
may here forgive the sins of men,
I say, (and then he spoke unto the
palsied man),</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Arise, take up your bed, and
go your way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And in the presence of them
all the man arose, took up his bed,
and went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The people could not comprehend
the things they heard and
saw. They said among themselves,
This is a day we never can forget;
we have seen wondrous things today.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And when the multitudes
had gone the twelve remained, and
Jesus said to them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The Jewish festival draws
near; next week we will go to Jerusalem,
that we may meet our
brethren from afar, and open up to
them the way that they may see
the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> The Christines sought the
quiet of their homes, where they remained
in prayer for certain days.</p>

<i>The Second Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_91">CHAPTER 91.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus at the feast in Jerusalem.
Heals an impotent man. Gives a
practical lesson in healing. Affirms
that all men are the sons of
God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> feast time came and Jesus
and the twelve went to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Upon the day before the Sabbath
day they reached Mount Olives
and they tarried at an inn before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Mount Olives on the north.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And in the early morning of
the Sabbath day they went in
through the sheep gate to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The healing fountain of Bethesda,
near the gate, was thronged
about with people who were sick;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> For they believed that at a
certain time an angel came and
poured a healing virtue in the pool,
and those who entered first and
bathed, would be made whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus and the twelve
were standing near the pool.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus saw a man near by
who had been stricken eight and
thirty years; without a hand to help
he could not move.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said to him, My
brother, man, would you be healed?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The man replied, I earnestly
desire to be healed; but I am helpless
and when the angel comes and
pours the healing virtues in the
pool,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Another who can walk, steps
in the fountain first and I am left
unhealed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Who sends
an angel here to potentize this pool
for just a favored few?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> I know it is not God, for he
deals just the same with every one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> One has no better chance in
heaven&#8217;s healing fountain than another
one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The fount of health is in
your soul; it has a door locked fast;
the key is faith;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And every one can have this
key and may unlock the door and
plunge into the healing fount and
be made whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And then the man looked up
in hopeful mood and said, Give me
this key of faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, Do you believe
what I have said? According
to your faith it shall be done.
Arise, take up your bed and walk.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The man at once arose and
walked away; he only said, Praise
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And when the people asked,
Who made you whole? the man replied,
I do not know. A stranger
at the pool just spoke a word and
I was well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The many did not see when
Jesus healed the man, and with the
twelve he went his way up to the
temple courts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And in the temple Jesus saw
the man and said to him, Behold
you are made whole; from henceforth
guard your life aright;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Go on your way and sin no
more, or something worse may fall
on you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And now the man knew who
it was who made him whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> He told the story to the
priests and they were much enraged;
they said, The law forbids
a man to heal upon the Sabbath day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But Jesus said, My Father
works on Sabbath days and may
not I?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> He sends his rain, his sunshine
and his dew; he makes his
grass to grow, his flowers to bloom;
he speeds the harvests just the same
on Sabbath days as on the other
days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> If it is lawful for the grass to
grow and flowers to bloom on Sabbath
days it surely is not wrong to
succor stricken men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And then the priests were
angered more and more because he
claimed to be a son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> A leading priest, Abihu, said,
This fellow is a menace to our nation
and our laws; he makes himself to
be a son of God; it is not meet that
he should live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> But Jesus said, Abihu, Sir,
you are a learned man; you surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
know the law of life. Pray tell
who were the sons of God we read
about in Genesis, who took to wife
the daughters of the sons of men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Our father Adam; who was
he? From whence came he? Had
he a father? or did he fall from
heaven as a star?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> We read that Moses said, He
came from God. If Adam came
from God, pray, was he offspring,
was he son?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> We are the children of this
son of God; then tell me, learned
priest, Who are we if not sons of
God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The priest had urgent business
and he went his away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And Jesus said, All men are
sons of God and if they live a holy
life they always are at home with
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> They see and understand
the works of God, and in his sacred
name they can perform these works.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> The lightnings and the
storms are messengers of God as
well as are the sunshine, rain and
dew.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The virtues of the heavens
are in God&#8217;s hands, and every loyal
son may use these virtues and these
powers.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> Man is the delegate of God
to do his will on earth, and man can
heal the sick, control the spirits of
the air, and raise the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Because I have the power to
do these things is nothing strange.
All men may gain the power to do
these things; but they must conquer
all the passions of the lower self;
and they can conquer if they will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> So man is God on earth, and
he who honors God must honor man;
for God and man are one, as father
and the child are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Behold, I say, The hour has
come; the dead will hear the voice
of man, and live, because the son
of man is son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> You men of Israel, hear! you
live in death; you are locked up
within the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> (There is no deeper death
than ignorance and unbelief.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> But all will some day hear
the voice of God, made plain by
voice of man, and live. You all will
know that you are sons of God, and
by the sacred Word, may do the
works of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> When you have come to life,
that is, have come to realize that
you are sons of God, you who have
lived the life of right, will open up
your eyes on fields of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> But you who love the ways
of sin will, in this resurrection, stand
before a judgment bar, and be condemned
to pay the debts you owe
to men and to yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> For whatsoever you have
done amiss must be performed again,
and yet again, until you reach the
stature of the perfect man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> But in due time the lowest
and the highest will arise to walk in

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines at a feast in Lazarus&#8217;
home. A fire rages in the town.
Jesus rescues a child from the
flames and stays the fire by the
Word. He gives a practical lesson
on how to redeem a drunken

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Lazarus was at the feast
and Jesus and the twelve went
with him to his home in Bethany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">2</span> And Lazarus and his sisters
made a feast for Jesus and the
twelve; and Ruth and Asher came
from Jericho; for Asher was no
longer hostile to the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And while the guests sat at
the board behold a cry, The village
is a-fire! and all rushed out into the
streets, and, lo, the homes of many
neighbors were in flames.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And in an upper room an infant
lay asleep, and none could pass
the flames to save. The mother,
wild with grief, was calling on the
men to save her child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Then, with a voice that made
the spirits of the fire pale and tremble,
Jesus said, Peace, peace, be
still!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then he walked through
smoke and flame, climbed up the
falling stair, and in a moment came
again, and in his arms he brought
the child. And not a trace of fire
was on himself, his raiment, or the
child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Then Jesus raised his hand,
rebuked the spirits of the fire, commanding
them to cease their awful
work, and be at rest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then, as though the waters
of the sea were all at once poured
on the flames, the fire ceased to
burn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when the fury of the fire
was spent the multitudes were wild
to see the man who could control
the fire, and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Man was not made for fire,
but fire was made for man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> When man comes to himself
and comprehends the fact that he is
son of God, and knows that in himself
lies all the powers of God, he is a
master mind and all the elements
will hear his voice and gladly do his
will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Two sturdy asses bind the
will of man; their names are Fear
and Unbelief. When these are
caught and turned aside, the will
of man will know no bounds; then
man has but to speak and it is done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then the guests returned
and sat about the board. A little
child came in and stood by Jesus&#8217;
side.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> She laid her hand on Jesus&#8217;
arm and said, Please, Master Jesus,
hear! my father is a drunken man;
my mother toils from morn till
night and when she brings her wages
home my father snatches them
away and squanders every cent for
drink, and mother and us little ones
are hungry all the night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Please, Master Jesus, come
with me and touch my father&#8217;s heart.
He is so good and kind when he is
just himself; I know it is the wine
that makes another man of him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus went out with the
child; he found the wretched home;
he spoke in kindness to the mother
and the little ones, and then upon a
bed of straw he found the drunken
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> He took him by the hand
and raised him up and said, My
brother, man, made in the image
of our Father-God, will you arise
and come with me?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Your neighbors are in sore
distress; they have lost all they had
in this fierce fire, and men must
build their homes again and you
and I must lead the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the man arose;
the two went arm in arm to view
the wrecks.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They heard the mothers and
the children crying in the streets;
they saw their wretchedness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said, My friend,
here is a work for you to do. Just
lead the way in helpfulness; I&#8217;m
sure the men of Bethany will furnish
you the means and help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">22</span> The spark of hope that had
so long been smouldering in the man
was fanned into a flame. He threw
his ragged coat aside; he was himself
again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then he called for help;
not for himself, but for the homeless
ones; and everybody helped.
The ruined homes were built again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he saw his own
poor den; his heart was stirred into
its depths.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The pride of manhood filled
his soul; he said, This wretched den
shall be a home. He worked as he
had never wrought before, and everybody
helped.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And in a little while the den
became a home indeed; the flowers
of love bloomed everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The mother and the little
ones were filled with joy; the father
never drank again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> A man was saved, and no one
ever said a word about neglect or
drunkenness, nor urged him to reform.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Another</span> Sabbath day had
come and Jesus and the
twelve walked through a field of
ripened wheat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And they were hungry and
they took the heads of wheat and in
their hands threshed out the grain
and ate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Among the men who followed
them were Pharisees of strictest
sect, and when they saw the twelve
thresh out the wheat and eat, they
said to Jesus,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Sir, why do the twelve do that
which is not lawful on the Sabbath
day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Have you not
heard what David did when he and
those who followed him had need of
food?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> How he went to the house of
God and from the table in the Holy
Place took of the presence bread
and ate, and gave to those who followed
him?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> I tell you, men, the needs of
man are higher than the law of rites.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And in our sacred books we
read how priests profane the Sabbath
day in many ways while they
are serving in the Holy Place, and
still are free from guilt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The Sabbath day was made
for man; man was not made to fit
the Sabbath day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The man is son of God and
under the eternal law of right, which
is the highest law, he may annul
the statute laws.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The law of sacrifice is but
the law of man, and in our law we
read that God desires mercy first;
and mercy stands above all statute
laws.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The son of man is Lord of
every law. Did not a prophet sum
the duties of the man when in the
book he wrote: In mercy follow justice
and walk humbly with your
God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
returned to Galilee, and on the day
before the Sabbath day they reached
the home of Jesus in Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And on the Sabbath day
they went up to the synagogue.
The multitudes were there and
Jesus taught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">15</span> Among the worshippers was
one, a man who had a withered
hand. The scribes and Pharisees
observed that Jesus saw the man,
and then they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> What will he do? Will he
attempt to heal upon the Sabbath
day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus knew their
thoughts and he called to the man
who had the withered hand and
said, Arise, stand forth before these
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus said, You scribes
and Pharisees, speak out and answer
me: Is it a crime to save a life
upon the Sabbath day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> If you had sheep and one
of them fell in a pit upon the Sabbath
day would you do wrong to
take it out?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Or would it please your God
to let it suffer in the mire until another
day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> But his accusers held their
peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And then he said to them,
Are sheep of greater value than a
man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The law of God is written
on the rock of Right; and Justice
wrote the law, and Mercy was the
pen.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he said, Man, raise
your hand and stretch it forth. He
raised his hand; it was restored.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The Pharisees were filled
with rage. They called in secret
council the Herodians, and they began
to plot and plan how they might
bring about his death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> They were afraid to publicly
accuse, because the multitudes
stood forth in his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus and the twelve
went down and walked beside the
sea, and many people followed
them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Sermon on the Mount. Jesus reveals
to the twelve the secret of
prayer. The model prayer. The
law of forgiveness. The holy fast.
The evil of deceit. Almsgiving.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning e&#8217;er the sun had
risen Jesus and the twelve
went to a mountain near the sea to
pray; and Jesus taught the twelve
disciples how to pray. He said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Prayer is the deep communion
of the soul with God;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> So when you pray do not deceive
yourselves as do the hypocrites
who love to stand upon the
streets and in the synagogues and
pour out many words to please the
ears of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And they adorn themselves
with pious airs that they may have
the praise of men. They seek the
praise of men and their reward is
sure.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> But when you pray, go to the
closet of your soul; close all the
doors, and in the holy silence, pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> You need not speak a multitude
of words, nor yet repeat the
words again and then again, as
heathen do. Just say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Our Father-God who art in
heaven; holy is thy name. Thy
kingdom come; thy will be done on
earth as it is done in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Give us this day our needed
bread;</p>

other people owe to us, that all our
debts may be discharged.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And shield us from the
tempter&#8217;s snares that are too great
for us to bear;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when they come give
us the strength to overcome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If you would be discharged
from all the debts you owe to God
and man, the debts you have incurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
by wilfully transgressing law,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> You must pass by the debts
of every man; for as you deal with
other men your God will deal with
you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And when you fast you may
not advertise the deed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> When fast the hypocrites
they paint their faces, look demure,
assume a pious pose, that they may
seem to men to fast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> A fast is deed of soul, and
like a prayer, it is a function of the
silence of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> God never passes by unnoticed
any prayer, or fast. He walks
within the silence, and his benedictions
rest on every effort of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Deception is hypocrisy, and
you shall not assume to be what
you are not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> You may not clothe yourselves
in special garb to advertise
your piety, nor yet assume the tone
of voice that men conceive to be a
holy voice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And when you give to aid the
needy ones, blow not a trumpet in
the street, nor synagogue to advertise
your gift.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> He who does alms for praise
of men has his reward from men;
but God regardeth not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> In giving alms do not let the
right hand know the secret of the
left.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The spirit of the law avers
that he who shall desire to kill, or
seeks revenge, is angry with a man
without sufficient cause, must answer
to the judge;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And he who calls his brother
soulless vagabond shall answer to
the council of the just;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And he who calls his brother
a degenerate, a dog, fans into life
the burning fires of hell within himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, in the higher law we
read that if your brother is aggrieved
by something you have
done, before you offer unto God
your gifts, go forth and find your
brother and be reconciled to him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> It is not well to let the sun
go down upon your wrath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If he will not be reconciled
when you have laid aside all selfish
pleas, have waived all selfish rights,
you will be guiltless in the sight of
God; then go and offer unto God
your gifts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> If you owe aught to any man
and cannot pay; or if a man shall
claim a greater sum than is his due,
it is not well that you dispute his
claims.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Resistance is the sire of
anger; there is no mercy and no reason
in a wrathful man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> I tell you it is better far to
suffer loss than go to law, or call
upon the courts of men to judge of
right and wrong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The law of carnal man would
say, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth;
resist encroachment on your rights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But this is not the law of God.
The Holy Breath would say, Resist
not him who would deprive you of
your goods.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> He who would take your coat
by force is still a brother man and
you should gain his heart, which by
resistance cannot be done;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Give him your coat and offer
him still more and more; in time the
man will rise above the brute; you
will have saved him from himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Refuse not him who calls for
help and give to him who asks to
borrow aught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And if a man shall strike you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
in a fitful, or an angry way, it is not
well to smite him in return.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Men call him coward who
will not fight and thus defend his
rights; but he is much the greater
man who is assailed, is smitten and
does not smite;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Who is maligned and answers
not, than he who smites the smiter
and reviles the one who slanders
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> It has been said in olden
times that man shall love his friend
and hate his foe; but, lo, I say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Be merciful unto your foes;
bless those who slander you; do
good to those who do you harm
and pray for those who trample
on your rights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Remember, you are children
of the God who makes his sun to
rise alike upon the evil and the good,
who sends his rain upon the unjust
and the just.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> If you do unto other men as
they do unto you, you are but
slaves, but followers in the way to
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But you, as children of the
light, must lead the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> When you do good to those
who have done good to you, you do
no more than other men; the publicans
do that.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> If you salute your friends
and not your foes, you are like other
men; the publicans have set the
pace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Be perfect as your Father-God
in heaven is.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> law forbids adultery; but in
the eyes of law adultery is an
overt act, the satisfaction of the
sensuous self outside the marriage
bonds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Now, marriage in the sight of
law is but a promise made by man
and woman, by the sanction of a
priest, to live for aye in harmony
and love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> No priest nor officer has
power from God to bind two souls in
wedded love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> What is the marriage tie? Is
it comprised in what a priest or officer
may say?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Is it the scroll on which the
officer or priest has written the permission
for the two to live in marriage
bonds?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Is it the promise of the two
that they will love each other until
death?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Is love a passion that is subject
to the will of man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Can man pick up his love, as
he would pick up precious gems,
and lay it down, or give it out to
any one?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Can love be bought and sold

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Love is the power of God
that binds two souls and makes
them one; there is no power on earth
that can dissolve the bond.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The bodies may be forced
apart by man or death for just a
little time; but they will meet again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, in this bond of God we
find the marriage tie; all other
unions are but bonds of straw, and
they who live in them commit adultery,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The same as they who satisfy
their lust without the sanction of an
officer or priest.</p>

his heart desires to possess that
which is not his own, and would deprive
the owner of the thing without
his knowledge or consent, is in

injures or defames that name has
taken what is not his own, and is a

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Upon a table of the law we
also read; Thou shalt not covet
anything.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> To covet is an all-consuming

<p class="hang"><i>The Sermon on the Mount, continued.
Jesus formulates and presents to
the twelve a practical code of spiritual
ethics.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a rule that carnal man
has made, and which he rigidly
observes:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Do unto other men as they do
unto you. As others judge, they
judge; as others give, they give.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now, while you walk with
men as men, judge not, and you
shall not be judged.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> For as you judge you shall be
judged, and as you give it shall be
given to you. If you condemn,
you are condemned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When you show mercy, men
are merciful to you, and if you love
in such a way that carnal man can
comprehend your love, you will be
well beloved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And so the wise man of this
world does unto other men as he
would have them do to him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The carnal man does good to
other men for selfish gain, for he expects
to have his blessings multiplied
and then returned; he does not
stop to note the end.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Man is himself the field; his
deeds are seeds, and what he does
to others grows apace; the harvest
time is sure.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold the yield! If he has
sown the wind, he reaps the wind;
if he has sown the noxious seeds of
scandal, theft and hate; of sensuality
and crime,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The harvest is assured and
he must reap what he has sown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
yea, more; the seeds produce an
hundred fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The fruit of righteousness
and peace and love and joy can
never spring from noxious seeds; the
fruit is like the seed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And when you sow, sow seeds
of right, because it is the right, and
not in way of trade, expecting rich
rewards.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The carnal man abhors the
spirit law, because it takes away his
liberty to live in sin; beneath its
light he cannot satisfy his passions
and desires.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> He is at enmity with him
who walks in Holy Breath. The
carnal man has killed the holy men
of old, the prophets and the seers.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And he will buffet you; will
charge you falsely, scourge you and
imprison you, and think he does the
will of God to slay you in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> But you may not prejudge
nor censure him who does you
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Each one has problems to be
solved, and he must solve them for
himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The man who scourges you
may have a load of sin to bear; but
how about your own?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> A little sin in one who walks
in Holy Breath is greater in the
sight of God than monster sins in
him who never knew the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> How can you see the splinter
in your brother&#8217;s eye while you have
chunks within your own?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> First take the chunks from
out your eye and then you may behold
the splinter in your brother&#8217;s
eye and help him take it out,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And while your eyes are full
of foreign things you cannot see the
way, for you are blind,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And when the blind lead
forth the blind, both lose the way
and fall into the slough.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> If you would lead the way to
God you must be clear in sight, as
well as pure in heart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> home of Jesus was a school
where in the early morning
hours the twelve apostles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
foreign priests were taught the secret
things of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And there were present priests
from China, India and from Babylon;
from Persia, Egypt and from
Greece,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Who came to sit at Jesus&#8217; feet
to learn the wisdom that he brought
to men, that they might teach their
people how to live the holy life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus taught them how
to teach; he told them of the trials
of the way, and how to make these
trials serve the race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He taught them how to live
the holy life that they might conquer
death;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> He taught them what the end
of mortal life will be, when man has
reached the consciousness that he
and God are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The after midday hours were
given to the multitudes who came
to learn the way of life and to be
healed; and many did believe and
were baptized.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, in his prison by the Bitter
Sea the harbinger had heard of
all the mighty works that Jesus did.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> His prison life was hard, and
he was sore distressed, and he began
to doubt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And to himself he said, I
wonder if this Jesus is the Christ of
whom the prophets wrote!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Was I mistaken in my work?
Was I, indeed, one sent from God
to pave the way for him who shall
redeem our people, Israel?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then he sent some of his
friends, who came to see him in his
prison cell, up to Capernaum that
they might learn about this man,
and bring him word.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The men found Jesus in his
home, and said, Behold the harbinger
sent us to ask, Are you the
Christ? or is he yet to come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But Jesus answered not; he
simply bade the men to tarry certain
days that they might see and hear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> They saw him heal the sick,
and cause the lame to walk, the deaf
to hear, the blind to see;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They saw him cast the evil
spirits out of those obsessed; they
saw him raise the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> They heard him preach the
gospel to the poor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Then Jesus said to them, Go
on your way; return to John and tell
him all that you have seen and
heard; then he will know. They
went their way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The multitudes were there,
and Jesus said to them, Once you
were crowding Jordan&#8217;s fords; you
filled the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> What did you go to see?
The trees of Juda, and the flowers
of Heth? Or did you go to see a
man in kingly garb? Or did you
go to see a prophet and a seer?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I tell you, men, you know
not whom you saw. A prophet?
Yea, and more; a messenger whom
God had sent to pave the way for
what you see and hear this day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Among the men of earth a
greater man has never lived than
John.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Behold I say, This man whom
Herod bound in chains and cast
into a prison cell, is God&#8217;s Elijah
come again to earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Elijah, who did not pass the
gates of death, whose body of this
flesh was changed, and he awoke
in Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> When John came forth and
preached the gospel of repentance
for the cleansing of the soul, the
common folks believed and were
baptized.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The lawyers and the Pharisees
accepted not the teachings of
this man; were not baptized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">27</span> Behold, neglected opportunities
will never come again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Behold, the people are unstable
as the waters of the sea; they
seek to be excused from righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> John came and ate no bread,
and drank no wine. He lived the
simplest life apart from men, and
people said, He is obsessed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Another comes who eats and
drinks and lives in homes like other
men, and people say, He is a glutton,
an inebriate, a friend of publicans
and those who sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Woe unto you, you cities of
the vale of Galilee, where all the
mighty works of God are done!
Woe to Chorazan and Bethsaida!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> If half the mighty works
that have been done in you were
done in Tyre and in Sidon they
would have long ago repented of
their sins, and sought the way of
right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And when the judgment day
shall come, lo, Tyre and Sidon will
be called more worthy than will you,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> Because they slighted not
their gifts, while you have thrown
away the pearl of greatest price.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Woe unto you Capernaum!
Behold, you are exalted now, but
you shall be abased;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> For if the mighty works that
have been done in you had but been
done within the cities of the plain&mdash;of
Sodom and Zeboim&mdash;they would
have heard and turned to God;
would not have been destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> They perished in their ignorance;
they had no light; but you
have heard; you have the evidence.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The light of life has shown
above your hills and all the shores
of Galilee have been ablaze with
light;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The glory of the Lord has
shown in every street and synagogue
and home; but you have
spurned the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And, lo, I say, The judgment
day will come and God will deal in
greater mercy with the cities of the
plains than he will deal with you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The men of learning and of

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And though they walked within

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus cast his eyes to

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Then turning to the multitudes
he said, I come to you not in

my own;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The wisdom and the virtue
that I bring to you are from above;
they are the wisdom and the virtue

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> A Pharisee, whose name was

the honored guest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And as they sat about the
board, a courtesan who had been
cured of her desire to sin by what
she had received and seen in Jesus&#8217;
ministry, came uninvited to the
feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> She brought an alabaster box
of costly balm and as the guests reclined
she came to Jesus in her joy,
because she had been freed from
sin,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Her tears fell fast, she kissed
his feet, and dried them with her
hair, and she anointed them with
balm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Simon thought, he did
not speak aloud, This man is not a
prophet or he would know the kind
of woman that approaches him, and
would drive her away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But Jesus knew his thoughts,
and said to him, My host, I have a
word to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Simon said, Say on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, Sin is a monster
of iniquity; it may be small; it
may be large; it may be something
done; it may be something left undone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Behold, one person leads a
life of sin and is at last redeemed;
another, in a careless mood, forgets
to do the things he ought to do;
but he reforms and is forgiven.
Now, which of these has merited
the higher praise?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Simon said, The one
who overcame the errors of a life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, You speak
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Behold, this woman who has
bathed my feet with tears and dried
them with her hair and covered
them with balm!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> For years she led a life of sin,
but when she heard the words of
life she sought forgiveness and she
found.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> But when I came into your
house as guest you gave me not a
bowl of water that I might wash
my hands and feet, which every
loyal Jew must do before he feasts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Now, tell me, Simon, which
of these, this woman or yourself,
is worthy of most praise?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But Simon answered not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Then to the woman Jesus
said, Your sins are all forgiven; your
faith has saved you; go in peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And then the guests who sat
around the board, began to say
within themselves, What manner of
a man is this who says, Thy sins
are all forgiven?</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> many women who possessed

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Among these anxious ones
were Mary Magdalene, who was obsessed
by seven homeless spirits of

by the Omnific Word which Jesus

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Susanna, who owned vast estates
at Cæsarea-Philippi;</p>

raised the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus wrought and taught
from early morn until the day had
gone, and then into the night; he did
not stop to eat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> His friends became alarmed
lest he should fail from loss of
strength, and they laid hold of him
and would, by force, have taken him
away to place of rest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But he rebuked them not;
he said, Have you not read that
God will give his angels charge concerning
me?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> That they would hold me fast
and suffer not that I should come to
want?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> I tell you, men, while I am
giving out my strength unto these
anxious, waiting throngs I find myself
at rest within the arms of God,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Whose blessed messengers
bring down to me the bread of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> There is a tide just once in
human life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> These people now are willing
to receive the truth; their opportunity
is now: our opportunity is now.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And if we do not teach them
while we may, the tide will ebb;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> They may not care again to
hear the truth; then tell me, Who
will bear the guilt?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And so he taught and healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Among the multitudes were
men of every shade of thought.
They were divided in their views
concerning everything that Jesus
said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Some saw in him a God, and
would have worshipped him; and
others saw in him a devil of the
nether world and would have cast
him in a pit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And some were trying hard
to lead a double life; like little lions
of the ground that take upon themselves
the color of the thing they
rest upon.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> These people without anchorage
of any sort, are friends or
foes as seemed to serve them best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus said, No man can
serve two masters at a time. No
man can be a friend and foe at once.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> He is a coward who would
feign to be a friend, or foe, to please
another man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> You men, do not deceive
yourselves in thought; your hearts
are known;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Hypocrisy will blight a soul
as surely as the breath of Beelzebul.
An honest evil man is more esteemed
by guardians of the soul
than a dishonest pious man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> If you would curse the son of
man, just curse him out aloud.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> A curse is poison to the inner
man, and if you hold and swallow
down a curse it never will digest;
lo, it will poison every atom of your
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And if you sin against a son
of man, you may be pardoned and
your guilt be cleansed by acts of
kindness and of love;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> But if you sin against the
Holy Breath by disregarding her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
when she would open up the doors
of life for you;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> By closing up the windows
of the soul when she would pour the
light of love into your hearts, and
cleanse them with the fires of God;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Your guilt shall not be blotted
out in this, nor in the life to
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> An opportunity has gone to
come no more, and you must wait

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Then will the Holy Breath
again breathe on your fires of life,
and fan them to a living flame.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Then she will open up the
doors again, and you may let her
in to sup with you forevermore, or
you may slight her once again, and
then again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> You men of Israel, your opportunity
is now.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Your tree of life is an illusive
tree; it has a generous crop of
leaves; its boughs hang low with

fruit!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> Then Jesus spoke a word that
nature spirits know, and lo, the fig
tree stood a mass of withered leaves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> And then he spoke again,
Behold, for God will speak the
Word, and you will stand a withered
fig tree in the setting sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> You men of Galilee, send
forth and call the pruner in before
it is too late, and let him prune away
your worthless branches and illusive
leaves, and let the sunshine in.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> The sun is life, and it can
change your worthlessness to worth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> Your tree of life is good;
but you have nurtured it so long
with dews of self, and mists of carnal
things that you have shut the
sunshine out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> I tell you, men, that you
must give account to God for every
idle word you speak and every evil
deed you do.</p>

scribes and Pharisees, you cannot
see a spirit-sign, because your
spirit eyes are full of carnal self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You seek a sign to please your
curiosity. You walk the very lowest
planes of carnal life and cry,
Phenomena! show us a sign and
then we will believe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> I was not sent to earth to buy
up faith as men buy fish and fruit
and rubbish in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Men seem to think it quite a
favor done to me when they confess
their faith in me and in the holy
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> What does it matter unto
me as man if you believe or disbelieve?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Faith is not something you
can buy with coin; it is not something
you can sell for gold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Once Mart, a beggar, followed
me and cried, Give me a silver
piece; then I will believe in you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And you are like this beggar
man; you offer to exchange your
faith for signs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But I will give to all the
world one sign as surety that the
Christ abides with me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> You all have read the parable
of Jonah and the fish, wherein it
is recorded that the prophet spent
three days and nights within the
stomach of the mighty fish, and
then came forth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The son of man will spend
three days and nights within the
heart of earth and then come forth
again, and men will see and know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Behold, the light may be so
bright that men cannot see anything.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The Spirit light has shown so
brightly over Galilee that you who
hear me now are blind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> You may have read the words
of prophet Azrael; he said, The light
shall shine out brightly in the darkness
of the night, and men shall
comprehend it not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> That time has come; the
light shines forth; you see it not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The Queen of Sheba sat in
darkest night and still she yearned
for light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> She came to hear the words
of wisdom from the lips of Solomon,
and she believed;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And she became a living
torch, and when she reached her
home, lo, all Arabia was filled with
light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> A greater far than Solomon
is here; the Christ is here; the Day
Star has arisen, and you reject the
light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And you remember Nineveh,
the wicked city of Assyria, which
God had marked to be destroyed
by shock and flame unless the people
turned and walked in ways of
right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jonah raised his voice
and said, In forty days shall Nineveh
be razed, and all her wealth
shall be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">28</span> The people heard and they
believed; and they reformed and
turned to ways of right, and lo,
their city was not razed; was not destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> You men of Galilee, I tell
you that Arabia and Nineveh will
testify against you in the judgment
day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Behold, for every one to
whom I speak has in him all the
fires of God; but they are lying
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The will is bridled by the
flesh desires, and it brings not the
ethers of the fires to vibrate into
light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Look, therefore, to your soul
and note, Is not the light within
you dark as night?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> There is no breath but Holy
Breath that e&#8217;er can fan your fires
of life into a living flame and make
them light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Holy Breath can raise
the ethers of the fires to light in
none but hearts of purity and love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Hear, then, you men of Galilee,
Make pure the heart, admit the
Holy Breath, and then your bodies
will be full of light,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And like a city on a hill, your
light will shine afar, and thus your
light may light the way for other
men.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> multitudes were wild with
selfish thought; none recognized
the rights and needs of any
other one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The stronger pushed the weak

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, Behold the

fiendish greed of selfish gain!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> I tell you, men, the benefits

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> They are unreal; they pass

the food does not assimilate;
the soul grows not, and then it must
be fed again, and then again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Behold, a selfish man obsessed
by just one spirit of the air; by the
Omnific Word the spirit is cast out;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> It wanders through dry places,

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then it comes again; the
selfish man has failed to close and
lock the door;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The unclean spirit finds the

in and takes with it full seven
other spirits more unclean than is itself;
and there they dwell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The last state of the man is
more than sevenfold more wretched
than the first.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And so it is with you who

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> While Jesus spoke a certain

hear, receive and live the word of

<span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus did not wash his
hands according to the strictest
Pharisaic rules, before he ate; when
this the Pharisee observed he marveled
much.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, My host, why
do you marvel that I did not wash
my hands?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The Pharisees wash well
their hands and feet; they cleanse
the body every day when, lo, within

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Their hearts are full of wickedness,
extortions and deceit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Did not the God who made
the outside of the body make the inside,

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then he said, Woe unto
you, you Pharisees! for you tithe
mint and rue, and every herb, and
pass by judgment and the love of
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Woe unto you, you Pharisees!
you love the highest seats in
synagogues and courts, and bid for
salutations in the market place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Woe unto you, you tinseled
gentry of the land! no man would
ever think you servants of the Lord
of hosts by what you do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> A lawyer sitting near remarked,
Rabboni, your words are
harsh, and then in what you say
you censure us; and why?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus said, Woe unto
you, you masters of the law! you
heap great burdens on the sons of
men, yea, loads by far too great for
them to bear, and you will never
help to bear a feather&#8217;s weight yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Woe unto you! you build the
tombs of prophets and of seers; they
whom your fathers killed; and you
are parties to the crimes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And now behold, for God
has sent again to you his holy men-apostles,
prophets, seers; and you
are persecuting them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The time is near when you
will plead against them in the

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> I tell you, men, the blood of
all the holy men of God that has

the altar in the Holy <span class="locked">Place&mdash;</span></p>

the rulers counseled how they might

will pass;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Their slaughter only hastens
nature&#8217;s work a little time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And when they kill the flesh
they reach their bounds of power;
they cannot kill the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But nature is the keeper of
the soul as of the flesh, and in the
harvest time of soul, the trees of
life are all inspected by the judge;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And every tree that bears
no fruit of good is plucked up by the

direct his thoughts, his loves, his
life, and gain the prize of everlasting

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And you are not abandoned
in your struggle for the crown of
life. Your Father lives, and you
shall live.</p>

he knows by name, and every one
is numbered in his Book of Life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And every hair upon your
head, and every drop of blood within
your veins, he knows by number
and by rythm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> He hears the birdling&#8217;s call,
the cricket&#8217;s chirp, the glow worm&#8217;s
song; and not a sparrow falls to
earth without his knowledge and
consent.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> A sparrow seems a thing of
little worth; yea, five of them are
worth two farthings in the market
place, and yet God cares for every
one of them.</p>

will serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> It matters not when he shall
come; it may be at the second watch;
it may be at the third; but blessed
are the servants who are ready to
receive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> You cannot leave your door
ajar and go to sleep, and wait in
blissful ignorance of the fleeting
time;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> For thieves will surely come
and take away your goods and bind
and carry you away to robbers&#8217;
dens.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And if you are not carried
forth, the Master when he comes
will not regard a sleeping guard as
friend, but as a foe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Beloved, these are times
when every man must be awake
and at his post, for none can tell
the hour nor the day when man
shall be revealed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Peter said, Lord is this
parable for us, or for the multitudes?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus said, Why need
you ask? God is not man that he
should show respect for one and
cast another off.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Whoever will may come and
gird himself, and trim his lamp, and
find a turret in the tower of life
where he may watch, and be prepared
to meet the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">20</span> But you, as children of the
light, have come, and you have
learned the language of the court,
and may stand forth and lead the
way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> But you may wait, and think
that you are ready to receive the
Lord, and still he does not come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And you may grow impatient
and begin to long for carnal
ways again, and may begin to exercise
your rule;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> To beat, and otherwise maltreat
the servants of the house, and
fill yourselves with wine and meat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And what will say the Lord
when he shall come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Behold, for he will cast the
faithless servant from his house;
and many years will come and go
before he can be cleansed, and be
thought worthy to receive his Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The servant who has come
into the light, who knows the Master&#8217;s
will and does it not; the trusted
guard who goes to sleep within the
turret of the tower of life,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Shall feel the lash of justice
many times, while he who does not
know his Master&#8217;s will and does it
not, will not receive the graver punishment.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The man who comes and
stands before the open door of opportunity
and does not enter in,
but goes his way,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Will come again and find the
door made fast, and when he calls,
the door will open not,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The guard will say, you had
the pass-word once, but you threw
it away and now the Master knows
you not; depart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And verily I say to you, To
whom much has been given, much
is required; to whom a little has
been given, a little only is required.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> after they had dined, the
guests and Jesus all were in a
spacious hall in Mary&#8217;s home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then Lamaas said, Pray,

peace?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Have we come forth unto the

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Are you, indeed, the Prince of
Peace that holy men have said
would come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Peace reigns
today; it is the peace of death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> A stagnant pool abides in
peace. When waters cease to move
they soon are ladened with the
seeds of death; corruption dwells in
every drop.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The living waters always leap
and skip about like lambs in spring.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The nations are corrupt; they
sleep within the arms of death and
they must be aroused before it is
too late.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> In life we find antagonists at
work. God sent me here to stir
unto its depths the waters of the
sea of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Peace follows strife; I come
to slay this peace of death. The
prince of peace must first be prince
of strife.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> This leaven of truth which I
have brought to men will stir the
demons up, and nations, cities,
families will be at war within themselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The five that have been
dwelling in a home of peace will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
divided now, and two shall war

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The son will stand against
his sire; the mother and the daughter
will contend; yea, strife will
reign in every home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The self and greed and doubt
will rage into a fever heat, and
then, because of me, the earth will
be baptized in human blood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But right is king; and when
the smoke is cleared away the nations
will learn war no more; the
Prince of Peace will come to reign.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold, the signs of what I
say are in the sky; but men can see
them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> When men behold a cloud
rise in the west they say, A shower
of rain will come and so it does; and
when the wind blows from the

Resentment makes more

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The Christines went their

<h3 id="CHAPTER_114">CHAPTER 114.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A great storm on the sea destroys
many lives. Jesus makes an appeal
for aid, and the people give
with a generous hand. In answer
to a lawyer&#8217;s question, Jesus gives
the philosophy of disasters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">As</span> Jesus taught, a man stood
forth and said, Rabboni, may
I speak?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus said, Say on. And
then the man spoke out and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> A storm upon the sea last
night wrecked many fishing boats,
and scores of men went down to
death, and, lo, their wives and children
are in need;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> What can be done to help
them in their sore distress?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, A worthy
plea. You men of Galilee, take
heed. We may not bring again to
live these men, but we can succor
those who looked to them for daily
bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> You stewards of the wealth
of God, an opportunity has come;
unlock your vaults; bring forth
your hoarded gold; bestow it with a
lavish hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> This wealth was laid aside for
just such times as these; when it was
needed not, lo, it was yours to
guard;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> But now it is not yours, for it
belongs to those who are in want,
and if you give it not you simply
bring upon your heads the wrath
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> It is not charity to give to
those who need; it is but honesty;
it is but giving men their own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Then Jesus turned to Judas,
one of the twelve, who was the
treasurer of the band, and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Bring forth our treasure box;
the money is not ours now; turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
every farthing to the help of those
in such distress.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, Judas did not wish to
give the money all to those in want,
and so he talked with Peter, James
and John.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> He said, Lo, I will save a certain
part and give the rest; that
surely is enough for us, for we are
strangers to the ones in want; we do
not even know their names.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But Peter said, Why, Judas,
man, how do you dare to think to
trifle with the strength of right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The Lord has spoken true;
this wealth does not belong to us in
face of this distress, and to refuse to
give it is to steal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> You need not fear; we will
not come to want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Judas opened up the
treasure box and gave the money
all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And there was gold and silver,
food, and raiment in abundance
for the needs of the bereaved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> A lawyer said, Rabboni, if
God rules the worlds and all that in
them is, did he not bring about this
storm? did he not slay these men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Has he not brought this sore
distress upon these people here?
and was it done to punish them for
crimes?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And we remember well when
once a band of earnest Jews from
Galilee were in Jerusalem, and at a
feast and were, for fancied crimes
against the Roman law,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Cut down within the very
temple court by Pontius Pilate;
and their blood became their sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Did God bring on this slaughter
all because these men were
doubly vile?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then we bring to mind
that once a tower called Siloam,
graced the defences of Jerusalem,
and, seemingly, without a cause it
tottered and it fell to earth and
eighteen men were killed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Were these men vile? and
were they slain as punishment for
some great crime?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, We cannot
look upon a single span of life and
judge of anything.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> There is a law that men must
recognize: Result depends on cause.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Men are not motes to float
about within the air of one short
life, and then be lost in nothingness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> They are undying parts of
the eternal whole that come and go,
lo, many times into the air of earth
and of the great beyond, just to
unfold the God-like self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> A cause may be a part of one
brief life; results may not be noted
till another life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The cause of your results
cannot be found within my life,
nor can the cause of my results be
found in yours.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> I cannot reap except I sow
and I must reap what e&#8217;er I sow,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The law of all eternities is
known to master minds:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> Whatever men do unto other
men the judge and executioner will
do to them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> We do not note the execution
of this law among the sons of
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> We note the weak dishonored,
trampled on and slain by
those men call the strong.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> We note that men with
wood-like heads are seated in the
chairs of state;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Are kings and judges, senators
and priests, while men with
giant intellects are scavengers about
the streets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> We note that women with a
moiety of common sense, and not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
whit of any other kind, are painted
up and dressed as queens,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Becoming ladies of the courts
of puppet kings, because they have
the form of something beautiful;
while God&#8217;s own daughters are their
slaves, or serve as common laborers
in the field.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> The sense of justice cries
aloud: This is a travesty on right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> So when men see no further
than one little span of life it is no
wonder that they say, There is no
God, or if there is a God he is a tyrant
and should die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> If you would judge aright of
human life, you must arise and
stand upon the crest of time and
note the thoughts and deeds of men
as they have come up through the
ages past;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> For we must know that man
is not a creature made of clay to
turn again to clay and disappear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> He is a part of the eternal
whole. There never was a time
when he was not; a time will never
come when he will not exist.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> And now we look; the men
who now are slaves were tyrants
once; the men who now are tyrants
have been slaves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> The men who suffer now,
once stood aloft and shouted with a
fiend&#8217;s delight while others suffered
at their hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> And men are sick, and halt,
and lame, and blind because they
once transgressed the laws of perfect
life, and every law of God must
be fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> Man may escape the punishment
that seems but due for his misdoings
in this life; but every deed
and word and thought has its own
metes and bounds,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> Is cause, and has its own results,
and if a wrong be done, the
doer of the wrong must make it
right.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">51</span> And when the wrongs have
all been righted then will man arise
and be at one with God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches by the sea. He relates
the parable of the sower. Tells
why he teaches in parables. Explains
the parable of the sower.
Relates the parable of the wheat
and tares.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">And</span> Jesus stood beside the sea
and taught; the multitudes
pressed close upon him and he
went into a boat that was near by
and put a little ways from shore,
and then he spoke in parables; he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Behold, a sower took his seed
and went into his field to sow.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> With lavish hand he scattered
forth the seed and some fell in the
hardened paths that men had
made,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And soon were crushed beneath
the feet of other men; and
birds came down and carried all the
seed away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Some seed fell on rocky ground
where there was little soil; they
grew and soon the blades appeared
and promised much;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But then there was no depth
of soil, no chance for nourishment,
and in the heat of noonday sun
they withered up and died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Some seed fell where thistles
grew, and found no earth in which
to grow and they were lost;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> But other seed found lodgment
in the rich and tender soil
and grew apace, and in the harvest
it was found that some brought
forth a hundred fold, some sixty
fold, some thirty fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They who have ears to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
may hear; they who have hearts
to understand may know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, his disciples were beside
him in the boat, and Thomas
asked, Why do you speak in parables?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, My words,
like every master&#8217;s words, are dual
in their sense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> To you who know the language
of the soul, my words have
meanings far too deep for other men
to comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The other sense of what I
say is all the multitude can understand;
these words are food for
them; the inner thoughts are food
for you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Let every one reach forth
and take the food that he is ready
to receive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then he spoke that all
might hear; he said, Hear you the
meaning of the parable:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Men hear my words and understand
them not, and then the
carnal self purloins the seed, and
not a sign of spirit life appears.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> This is the seed that fell
within the beaten paths of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And others hear the words
of life, and with a fiery zeal receive
them all; they seem to comprehend
the truth and promise well;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> But troubles come; discouragements
arise; there is no depth of
thought; their good intentions
wither up and die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> These are the seeds that fell
in stony ground.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And others hear the words
of truth and seem to know their
worth; but love of pleasure, reputation,
wealth and fame fill all the
soil; the seeds are nourished not
and they are lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> These are the seeds that fell
among the thistles and the thorns.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But others hear the words
of truth and comprehend them
well; they sink down deep into their
souls; they live the holy life and all
the world is blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> These are the seeds that fell
in fertile soil, that brought forth
fruit abundantly.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> You men of Galilee, take
heed to how you hear and how you
cultivate your fields; for if you slight
the offers of this day, the sower may
not come to you again in this or in
the age to come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Then Jesus spoke another
parable; he said:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The kingdom I may liken to
a field in which a man sowed precious
seed;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But while he slept an evil
one went forth and sowed a measure
full of darnel seed; then went
his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> The soil was good, and so
the wheat and darnel grew; and
when the servants saw the tares
among the wheat, they found the
owner of the field and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> You surely sowed good seed;
from whence these tares?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The owner said, Some evil
one has sown the seed of tares.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The servants said, Shall we
go out and pull up by the roots the
tares and burn them in the fire?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The owner said, No, that
would not be well. The wheat and
tares grow close together in the
soil, and while you pull the tares
you would destroy the wheat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> So we will let them grow together
till the harvest time. Then
to the reapers I will say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Go forth and gather up the
tares and bind them up and burn
them in the fire, and gather all the
wheat into my barns.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> When he had spoken thus,
he left the boat and went up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
house, and his disciples followed
him.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_116">CHAPTER 116.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines are in Philip&#8217;s home.
Jesus interprets the parable of the
wheat and tares. He explains the
unfoldment of the kingdom by parables:
the good seed; the growth of
the tree; the leaven; the hidden
treasure. He goes to a mountain
to pray.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christines were in Philip&#8217;s
home and Peter said to Jesus,
Lord, will you explain to us the
meaning of the parables you spoke
today? The one about the wheat
and tares, especially?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus said, God&#8217;s kingdom
is a dualty; it has an outer and
an inner form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> As seen by man it is composed
of men, of those who make confession
of the name of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> For various reasons various
people crowd this outer kingdom
of our God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The inner kingdom is the
kingdom of the soul, the kingdom
of the pure in heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The outer kingdom I may well
explain in parables. Behold, for I
have seen you cast a great net out
into the sea,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And when you hauled it in, lo,
it was full of every kind of fish,
some good, some bad, some great,
some small; and I have seen you
save the good and throw the bad
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> This outer kingdom is the
net, and every kind of man is
caught; but in the sorting day the
bad will all be cast away, the good
reserved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Hear, then, the meaning of
the parable of wheat and tares:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The sower is the son of man;
the field, the world; the good seed
are the children of the light; the
tares, the children of the dark;
the enemy, the carnal self; the harvest
day, the closing of the age; the
reapers are the messengers of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The reckoning day will come
to every man; then will the tares be
gathered up, and cast into the fire
and be burned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Then will the good shine
forth as suns in the kingdom of the
soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Philip said, Must men
and women suffer in the flames because
they have not found the way
of life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, The fire purifies.
The chemist throws into the
fire the ores that hold all kinds of
dross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The useless metal seems to
be consumed; but not a grain of gold
is lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> There is no man that has not
in him gold that cannot be destroyed.
The evil things of men
are all consumed in fire; the gold
survives.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The inner kingdom of the
soul I may explain in parables:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The son of man goes forth
and scatters seeds of truth; God
waters well the soil; the seeds show
life and grow; first comes the blade,
and then the stalk, and then the ear,
and then the full wheat in the ear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The harvest comes and, lo,
the reapers bear the ripened sheaves
into the garner of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Again, this kingdom of the
soul is like a little seed that men
may plant in fertile soil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> (A thousand of these seeds
would scarcely be a shekel&#8217;s weight.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The tiny seed begins to grow;
it pushes through the earth, and
after years of growth it is a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
tree and birds rest in its leafy bowers
and men find refuge &#8217;neath its
sheltering boughs from sun and
storm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Again, the truth, the spirit
of the kingdom of the soul, is like
a ball of leaven that a woman hid
in measures, three, of flour and in a
little time the whole was leavened.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Again, the kingdom of the
soul is like a treasure hidden in a
field which one has found, and
straitway goes his way and sells
all that he has and buys the field.</p>

he went alone into a mountain pass
near by to pray.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A royal feast is held in Machaerus.
John, the harbinger, is beheaded.
His body is buried in Hebron. His
disciples mourn. The Christines
cross the sea in the night. Jesus
calms a raging storm.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> royal feast was held in
honor of the birthday of the
tetrarch in fortified Machaerus, east
of the Bitter Sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The tetrarch, Herod, and his
wife, Herodias, together with Salome
were there; and all the men
and women of the royal court were
there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And when the feast was done,
lo, all the guests and courtiers were
drunk with wine; they danced and
leaped about like children in their
play.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Salome, daughter of Herodias,
came in and danced before the king.
The beauty of her form, her grace
and winning ways entranced the
silly Herod, then half drunk with
wine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He called the maiden to his
side and said, Salome, you have
won my heart, and you may ask
and I will give you anything you
wish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The maiden ran in childish
glee and told her mother what the
ruler said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Her mother said, Go back and
say, Give me the head of John, the
harbinger.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The maiden ran and told the
ruler what she wished.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Herod called his trusty
executioner and said to him, Go to
the tower and tell the keeper that
by my authority you come to execute
the prisoner known as John.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The man went forth and in
a little while returned and on a
platter bore the lifeless head of
John, and Herod offered it unto the
maiden in the presence of the guests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The maiden stood aloof; her
innocence was outraged when she
saw the bloody gift, and she would
touch it not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Her mother, steeped and
hardened well in crime, came up
and took the head and held it up
before the guests and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> This is the fate of every man
who dares to scorn, or criticize, the
acts of him who reigns.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The drunken rabble gazed
upon the grewsome sight with fiendish
joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The head was taken back
unto the tower. The body had
been given unto holy men who had
been friends of John; they placed it
in a burial case and carried it away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They bore it to the Jordan,
which they crossed just at the ford
where John first preached the
word;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And through the passes of
the Judean hills they carried it.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> They reached the sacred
grounds near Hebron, where the
bodies of the parents of the harbinger
lay in their tombs;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">19</span> And there they buried it;
and then they went their way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Now, when the news reached
Galilee that John was dead the people
met to sing the sonnets of the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus and the foreign
masters and the twelve took ship
to cross the sea of Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> A scribe, a faithful friend of
John, stood by the sea; he called to
Jesus and he said, Rabboni, let me
follow where you go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, You seek a
safe retreat from evil men. There
is no safety for your life with me;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> For evil men will take my
life as they have taken John&#8217;s.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The foxes of the earth have
safe retreats; the birds have nests
secure among the hidden rocks,
but I have not a place where I may
lay my head and rest secure.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Then an apostle said, Lord,
suffer me to tarry here a while, that
I may take my father, who is dead,
and lay him in the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But Jesus said, The dead can
care for those who die; the living
wait for those who live; come, follow
me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The evening came; three
boats put out to sea and Jesus
rested in the foremost boat; he
slept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> A storm came on; the boats
were tossed about like toys upon
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The waters swept the decks;
the hardy boatmen were afraid lest
all be lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Thomas found the master
fast asleep; he called, and Jesus
woke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Thomas said, Behold
the storm! have you no care for us?
The boats are going down.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus stood; he raised
his hand; he talked unto the spirits
of the winds and waves as men
would talk with men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And, lo, the winds blew not;
the waves came tremblingly and
kissed his feet; the sea was calm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And then he said, You men
of faith, where is your faith? for you
can speak and winds and waves will
hear and will obey.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And the disciples were
amazed. They said, Who is this
man that even winds and waves
obey his voice?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines are in Gadara. Jesus
casts a legion of unclean spirits
out of a man. The spirits go into
vicious animals which run into
the sea, and are drowned. The
people are in fear and request
Jesus to leave their coast. With

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning came; the Christines
landed in the country of
the Geracenes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They went to Gadara, chief
city of the Peracans, and here for
certain days they tarried and they
taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Now, legends hold that Gadara
is sacred to the dead, and all
the hills about are known as holy
ground.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> These are the burial grounds
of all the regions round about; the
hills are full of tombs; and many
dead from Galilee are here entombed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Now, spirits of the lately dead
that cannot rise to higher planes,
remain about the tombs that hold
the flesh and bones of what was once
their mortal homes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> They sometimes take possession
of the living, whom they torture
in a hundred ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">7</span> And all through Gadara were
men obsessed, and there was no one
strong enough to bring relief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> That they might meet these
hidden foes and learn the way to
dispossess the evil ones the master
took the foreign masters and the
twelve into the tombs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And as they neared the gates
they met a man obsessed. A legion
of the unclean ones were in this
man, and they had made him
strong;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And none could bind him
down, no, not with chains; for he
could break the stoutest chains, and
go his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Now, unclean spirits cannot
live in light; they revel in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> When Jesus came he brought
the light of life, and all the evil spirits
were disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The leader of the legion in
the man called out, Thou Jesus,
thou Immanuel, we beg that thou
wilt not consign it to the depths.
Torment us not before our time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, What is
your number and your name?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The evil spirit said, Our
name is legion, and our number is
the number of the beast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus spoke; and with
a voice that shook the very hills, he
said, Come forth; possess this man
no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Now, all the hills were filled
with unclean animals that fed, and
carried forth and spread the plague
among the people of the land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And when the evil spirits
begged that they might not be
driven forth without a home, the
master said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Go forth and take possession
of the unclean quadrupeds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And they, and all the evil
spirits of the tombs went forth and
took possession of the breeders of
the plague,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Which, wild with rage, ran
down the steeps into the sea, and all
were drowned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And all the land was freed
of the contagion, and the unclean
spirits came no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But when the people saw the
mighty works that Jesus did they
were alarmed. They said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> If he can free the country of
the plague, and drive the unclean
spirits out, he is a man of such
transcendent power that he can
devastate our land at will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And then they came and
prayed that he would not remain in
Gadara.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus did not tarry
longer there, and with the other
masters and the twelve, he went
aboard the boats to go away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The man who had been rescued
from the unclean legion stood
upon the shore and said, Lord, let
me go with you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But Jesus said, It is not well;
go forth unto your home and tell
the news that men may know what
man can do when he is tuned with
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then the man went
forth through all Decapolis and
told the news.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The Christines sailed away,
re-crossed the sea and came again
into Capernaum.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The people of Capernaum welcome
Jesus. Matthew gives a feast.

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> news soon spread through

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Matthew, one of the

home was in Capernaum, spread
forth a sumptuous feast, and Jesus

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And when the Pharisees observed
that Jesus sat and ate with
publicans and those of ill repute
they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> For shame! This man who

For shame!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> A band of John&#8217;s disciples
who had heard that John was dead
were wearing badges for their dead;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Were fasting and were praying

Pharisees observed they came to
Jesus and they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Why fast the followers of
John and your disciples do not fast?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Lo, you are
masters of the law; you ought to
know; perhaps you will make
known your knowledge to these
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> What are the benefits derived
from fasts? The Pharisees
were mute; they answered not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Then Jesus said, The vital
force of men depends on what they
eat and drink.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Is spirit-life the stronger
when the vital force is weak? Is
sainthood reached by starving, self
imposed?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> A glutton is a sinner in the
sight of God, and he is not a saint
who makes himself a weakling and
unfitted for the heavy tasks of life
by scorning to make use of God&#8217;s
own means of strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Lo, John is dead, and his
devoted followers are fasting in
their grief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Their love for him impels
them on to show respect, for they
have thought, and have been taught
that it is sin to lightly treat the
memory of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> To them it is a sin, and it is
well that they should fast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> When men defy their consciences
and listen not to what they
say, the heart is grieved and they
become unfitted for the work of life;
and thus they sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The conscience may be
taught. One man may do in conscience
what another cannot do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> What is a sin for me to do
may not be sin for you to do. The
place you occupy upon the way of
life determines what is sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> There is no changeless law
of good; for good and evil both are
judged by other things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> One man may fast and in his
deep sincerity of heart is blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Another man may fast and
in the faithlessness of such a task
imposed is cursed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> You cannot make a bed to fit
the form of every man. If you can
make a bed to fit yourself you have
done well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Why should these men who
follow me resort to fasting, or to
anything that would impair their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>

serve the race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The time will come when God
will let you have your way, and you
will do to me what Herod did to
John;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And in the awfulness of that
sad hour these men will fast.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Nicodemus, who once came

My child is very sick, I fear that she

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And as they went a woman

came and knelt at Jesus&#8217; feet and
told it all.</p>

has made you whole, go on your
way in peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Now, as he spoke, a servant
from the home of Jairus came and
said, My master, Jairus, trouble not
the Lord to come; your child is dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> But Jesus said, Jairus, man
of faith, do not permit your faith to
waver in this trying hour.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> What is it that the servant
said? The child is dead? Lo,
what is death?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> It is the passing of the soul
out of the house of flesh.</p>

can cleanse the empty house and

James and John, Jairus and the

closed against the multitude, he
spoke a word that souls can understand,

by the hand and said,</p>

The maiden&#8217;s soul returned and

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Are not his brothers, Jude
and James and Simon, known
among our honored men? Are not
his sisters with us here?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But they were all offended
by the words he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And Jesus said, A prophet
has no honor in his native land; he
is not well received among his kin;
his foes are in his home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Jesus wrought not many
mighty works in Nazareth, because
the people had no faith in him. He
did not tarry long.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> But as he passed from thence
two blind men followed him and
cried, Thou son of David, hear!
Have mercy, Lord, and open up
our eyes that we may see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, Do you believe
that I can open up your eyes
and make you see?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> They said, Yea, Lord, we
know that if you speak the Word
then we can see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And Jesus touched their
eyes and spoke the Word; he said,
According to your faith so will it be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And they were blest; they
opened up their eyes and saw.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And Jesus said, Tell not this
thing to any one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> But they went forth and told
the news through all the land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> As Jesus walked along the
way a man who was obsessed, and
who was dumb, was brought to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">40</span> And Jesus spoke the Word;
the unclean spirit came out of the
man; his tongue was loosed; he
spoke; he said, Praise God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> The people were amazed;
They said, This is a mighty deed;
we never saw that done before.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> The Pharisees were also much
amazed; but they cried out and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> You men of Israel, take
heed; this Jesus is a tool of Beelzebul;
he heals the sick and casts the
spirits out in Satan&#8217;s name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> But Jesus answered not; he
went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> And with the foreign masters
and the twelve he went up to the
town where he once turned the
water into wine and tarried certain
days.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_122">CHAPTER 122.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines spend seven days in
prayer. Jesus gives his charge to
the twelve and sends them forth on
their apostolic ministry, with instructions
to meet him in Capernaum.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christines prayed in silence
seven days; then Jesus called
the twelve aside and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Behold, the multitudes have
thronged about us everywhere; the
people are bewildered; they wander
here and there like sheep without a
fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They need a shepherd&#8217;s care;
they want a loving hand to lead
them to the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The grain is ripe; the harvest
is abundant, but the harvesters are
few.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The time is also ripe, and you
must go alone through all the villages
and towns of Galilee and teach
and heal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then he breathed upon
the twelve and said, Receive the
Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then he gave them each
the Word of power, and said, By
this Omnific Word you shall cast
spirits out, shall heal the sick and
bring the dead to life again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And you shall go not in the
way of the Assyrians, nor Greek;
you shall not go into Samaria; go
only to your brethren of the scattered
tribes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And as you go proclaim, The
kingdom of the Christ has come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> You have abundantly received,
and freely you shall give.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But you must go in faith;
provide yourselves no crutch to
lean upon.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Give all your gold and silver
to the poor; take not two coats, nor
extra shoes; just take your wands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> You are God&#8217;s husbandmen
and he will never suffer you to want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> In every place you go search
out the men of faith; with them
abide until you go from hence.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> You go for me; you act for
me. They who receive and welcome
you, receive and welcome me;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And they who shut their
doors against your face, refuse to
welcome me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> If you are not received in
kindness in a town, bear not away
an evil thought; do not resist.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> An evil thought of any kind
will do you harm; will dissipate your
power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> When you are not received
with favor, go your way, for there
are multitudes of men who want
the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Behold, I send you forth as
sheep among a pack of wolves; and
you must be as wise as serpents and
as harmless as the doves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> In all your language be discreet,
for Pharisees and scribes will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
seek a cause for your arrest in what
you say.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And they will surely find a
way by charges false to bring you
into court.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And judges will declare that
you are guilty of some crime, and
sentence you to scourgings and to
prison cells.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But when you come to stand
before the judge, be not afraid; be
not disturbed about the way to act,
the words to speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The Holy Breath will guide
you in that hour, and give the words
that you shall speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Of this be full assured; It is
not you who speaks; it is the Holy
Breath who gives the words and
moves the lips.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The gospel that you preach
will not bring peace, but it will stir
the multitudes to wrath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The carnal man abhors the
truth, and he would give his life to
crush the tender plant before the
harvest time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And this will bring confusion
in the homes that were the homes of
stagnant peace.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And brother will give brother
up to death; the father will stand
by and see men execute his child;
and in the courts the child will testify
against the sire, and gladly see
its mother put to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And men will hate you just
because you speak the name of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Thrice blessed is the man
who shall be faithful in this coming
day of wrath!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Go now; when you are persecuted
in a place, go seek another
place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And when you meet a foe
too great for you, behold, the son of
man is at your door, and he can
speak, and all the hosts of heaven
will stand in your defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> But do not hold your present
life in great esteem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> The time will come when men
will take my life; you need not hope
to be immune, for they will slay
you in the name of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Men call me Beelzebul and
they will call you imps.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Be not afraid of what men
say and do; they have no power
over soul; they may abuse and
may destroy the body of the flesh;
but that is all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> They do not know the God
who holds the issues of the soul
within his hands, who can destroy
the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> The Christ is king today, and
men must recognize his power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> He who loves not the Christ,
which is the love of God, before all
else, can never gain the prize of
spirit consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> And they who love their parents
or their children more than
they love the Christ can never wear
the name of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> And he who loves his life
more than he loves the Christ cannot
please God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> And he who clings to life
shall lose his life, while he who gives
his life for Christ will save his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> When Jesus had thus said
he sent the twelve away by twos,
and bade them meet him in Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> And they went out through
all the towns of Galilee and taught
and healed in spirit and in power.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christine master spent a
time in prayer and then he
called the foreign masters, and he
said to them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Behold, I sent the twelve apostles
unto Israel, but you are sent to
all the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Our God is one, is Spirit and is
truth, and every man is dear to
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He is the God of every child
of India, and the farther east; of
Persia, and the farther north; of
Greece and Rome and of the farther
west; of Egypt and the farther
south, and of the mighty lands
across the seas, and of the islands
of the seas.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> If God would send the bread
of life to one and not to all who
have arisen to the consciousness of
life and can receive the bread of
life, then he would be unjust and
that would shake the very throne
of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> So he has called you from the
seven centers of the world, and he
has breathed the breath of wisdom
and of power into your souls, and
now he sends you forth as bearers
of the light of life, apostles of the
human race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Go on your way, and as you
go proclaim the gospel of the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then he breathed upon
the masters and he said, Receive
the Holy Breath; and then he gave
to each the Word of power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And each went on his way,
and every land was blest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Then Jesus went alone across
the hills of Galilee and after certain
days he reached the coast of Tyre,
and in the home of Rachel he abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He did not advertise his
coming, for he did not come to
teach; he would commune with God
where he could see the waters of the
Mighty Sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But Rachel told the news
and multitudes of people thronged
her home to see the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> A Grecian woman of Phenecia
came; her daughter was obsessed.
She said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> O Lord, have mercy on my
home! My daughter is obsessed;
but this I know, if you will speak
the Word she will be free. Thou
son of David, hear my prayer!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But Rachel said, Good woman,
trouble not the Lord. He did
not come to Tyre to heal; he came
to talk with God beside the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Lo, I was
sent not to the Greek, nor to Syrophenicians;
I come just to my people,
Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And then the woman fell
down at his feet and said, Lord,
Jesus, I implore that you will save
my child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Jesus said, You know
the common proverb well: It is not
meet that one should give the children&#8217;s
bread to dogs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the woman said,
Yea, Jesus, this I know, but dogs
may eat the crumbs that fall down
from their master&#8217;s board.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, Such faith
I have not seen, no not among the
Jews; she is not serf, nor dog.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then he said to her, According
to your faith so let it be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The woman went her way
and when she came unto her child,
lo, she was healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus tarried many days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
in Tyre; and then he went his way
and dwelt a time in Sidon by the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he journeyed on.
In Lebanon hills and vales, and in
its groves he walked in silent
thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> His earthly mission fast was
drawing to a close; he sought for
strength, and what he sought he
found.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Mount Hermon stood beyond,
and Jesus fain would kneel
beside that mountain famed in Hebrew
song.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then he stood upon
Mount Hermon&#8217;s lofty peaks, and
lifting up his eyes to heaven he
talked with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And masters of the olden
times revealed themselves and long
they talked about the kingdom of
the Christ;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> About the mighty works
that had been done; about the coming
conquest of the cross; about the
victory over death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Then Jesus journeyed on;
he went to Cæsarea-Philippi, and in
Susanna&#8217;s home he tarried certain
days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And then he went through
all Decapolis to give encouragement
to those who knew him as the
Christ, and to prepare them for the
day of Calvary.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then he went to Gadara,
and many friends were there,
to welcome him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Chuzas, steward of the
house of Herod Antipas, was there,
and Jesus went aboard the royal
ship with him and crossed the sea,
and came unto Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And when the people knew
that Jesus was at home they came
to welcome him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> In just a little while the
twelve apostles came and told the
master all about their journey over
Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> They said that by the sacred
Word they had done many mighty
works; and Jesus said to them, Well
done.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines cross the sea. Jesus
gives to his disciples lessons on
secret doctrines. Teaches the people.
Feeds five thousand. The
disciples start to recross the sea.
A storm arises. Jesus, walking on
the waters, comes to them. Trial
of Peter&#8217;s faith. They land in
Gennesaret.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> twelve apostles now had
reached the stage of spirit consciousness,
and Jesus could reveal
to them the deeper meanings of his
mission to the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Next week the great feast of
the Jews would be observed, and
Matthew said, Shall we not girt ourselves
and go unto Jerusalem?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> But Jesus said, We will not go
up to the feast; the time is short and
I have many things to say to you;
come you apart into a desert place
and rest a while.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And then they took their boats
and crossed the sea, and came into a
desert place near Julius Bethsaida.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The people saw them go, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
in vast multitudes they followed
them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus had compassion on
the anxious throng, and he stood
forth and taught them all the day,
because they sought the light and
were like sheep without a fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And as the night came on the
twelve were doubting what the multitudes
would do, and Thomas said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Lord, we are in a desert place;
the multitudes have naught to eat
and they are faint from lack of food;
what shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, Go to and feed
the multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Judas said, Shall we go
down and buy two hundred pennies&#8217;
worth of bread for them to eat?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Go look into
our larder and see how many loaves
we have.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Andrew said, We have
no bread, but we have found a lad
who has five barley loaves and two
small fish; but this would not be
food enough for one in ten.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But Jesus said, Command
these people all to sit upon the grass
in companies of twelve; and they all
sat down in companies of twelve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Then Jesus took the loaves
and fish, and looking up to heaven
he spoke the sacred Word.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then he broke the bread
and gave it to the twelve; he also
gave the fish unto the twelve, and
said, Go to and feed the multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And all the people ate and
were refreshed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> There were about five thousand
men, a company of little ones,
and women not a few.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And when the people all were
filled the master said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Let not a crumb be lost; Go
to and gather up the pieces of the
bread and fish for others that may
want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They gathered up the fragments
and they filled twelve baskets
full.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The people were bewildered
by this wondrous act of power; they
said, And now we know that Jesus
is the prophet that our prophets
said would come; and then they
said, All hail the king!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> When Jesus heard them say,
All hail the king! he called the
twelve and bade them take their
boats and go before him to the other
side;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And he went all alone into
a mountain pass to pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The twelve were on the sea
and hoped to reach Capernaum in
just a little time, when all at once a
fearful storm arose, and they were
at the mercy of the waves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And in the fourth watch of
the night the wind became a whirling
wind, and they were filled with
fear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And in the blinding storm
they saw a form move on the waves;
it seemed to be a man, and one spoke
out and said, It is a ghost, a sign of
evil things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But John discerned the form
and said, It is the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And then the wind blew not
so hard, and Peter, standing in the
midst, exclaimed,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> My Lord! my Lord! If this
be truly you, bid me to come to you
upon the waves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The form reached forth his
hand and said, Come on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Peter stepped upon the
waves and they were solid as a rock;
he walked upon the waves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> He walked until he thought
within himself, What if the waves
should break beneath my feet?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And then the waves did
break beneath his feet, and he began
to sink, and in the fearfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of soul he cried, O save me, Lord, or
I am lost!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Jesus took him by the
hand and said, O you of little faith!
why did you doubt? And Jesus led
the way unto the boat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> The storm had spent its
force; the winds were still, and they
were near the shore, and when they
landed they were in the valley of
Gennesaret.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_125">CHAPTER 125.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines are welcomed in Gennesaret.
Many follow Jesus for
the loaves and fish. He tells them
of the bread of life. Speaks of his
flesh and blood as symbols of the
bread and water of life. The people
are offended and many of his disciples
follow him no more.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> news soon spread through
all the valley of Gennesaret
that Jesus and the twelve had come,
and many people came to see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They brought their sick and
laid them at the master&#8217;s feet, and
all the day he taught and healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The multitudes upon the other
side who had been fed the day before
and other multitudes, went
down to see the Lord; but when they
found him not they sought him in
Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And when they found him not
at home, they went on to Gennesaret.
They found him there and
said, Rabboni, when came you to
Gennesaret?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Why are you
come across the sea? you came not
for the bread of life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> You came to gratify your
selfish selves; you all were fed the
other day across the sea, and you
are after more of loaves and fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The food you ate was nourishment
for flesh that soon must
pass away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You men of Galilee, seek not
for food that perishes, but seek for
food that feeds the soul; and, lo, I
bring you food from heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> You ate the flesh of fish, and
you were satisfied, and now I bring
the flesh of Christ for you to eat that
you may live forevermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Our fathers ate the manna
in the wilderness; and then they ate
the flesh of quail, and drank the
waters of a flowing spring that
Moses brought out from the rock;
but all of them are dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The manna and the quail
were symbols of the flesh of Christ;
the waters of the rock were symbols
of the blood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But, lo, the Christ has come;
he is the bread of life that God has
given to the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Whoever eats the flesh of
Christ and drinks his blood shall
never die; and he will hunger nevermore;
and he will thirst no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And they who eat this bread
of heaven, and drink these waters
from the spring of life cannot be
lost; these feed the soul, and purify
the life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Behold, for God has said,
When man has purified himself I
will exalt him to the throne of
power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
went to Capernaum; and Jesus went
into the synagogue and taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And when the Jews, who
heard him in Gennesaret, were
come they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> This fellow is beside himself.
We heard him say, I am the bread
of life that comes from heaven; and
we all know that he is but a man,
the son of man, who came from Nazareth;
we know his mother, and his
other kin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus knew their
thoughts; he said to them, Why
murmur you, and reason thus
among yourselves?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The Christ is everlasting life;
he came from heaven; he has the
keys of heaven, and no man enters
into heaven except he fills himself
with Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I came in flesh to do the will
of God, and, lo, this flesh and blood
are filled with Christ; and so I am
the living bread that comes from
heaven;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And when you eat this flesh
and drink this blood you will have
everlasting life; and if you will,
you may become the bread of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And many of the people
were enraged; they said, How can
this man give us his flesh to eat, his
blood to drink?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And his disciples were aggrieved
because he said these things,
and many turned away and followed
him no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> They said, This is a fearful
thing for him to say, If you eat not
my flesh and drink my blood, you
cannot enter into life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> They could not comprehend
the parable he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, You stumble
and you fall before the truth; What
will you do when you shall see this
flesh and blood transmuted into
higher form?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> What will you say when you
shall see the son of man ascending
on the clouds of heaven?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> What will you say when you
shall see the son of man sit on the
throne of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The flesh is naught; the spirit
is the quickening power. The
words I speak are spirit; they are
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> When Jesus saw the many
who had been so loud in their professions
of their faith in him, turn
back and go away, he said unto the
twelve,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Will you desert me in this
hour and go away?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> But Peter said, Lord, we
have no place else to go; you have
the words of everlasting life; we
know that you are sent to us from
God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Scribes and Pharisees visit Jesus.
They censure him for eating with
unwashed hands. He defends his
acts and teaches a lesson on hypocrisy.
Privately explains to the
twelve his public teachings.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> company of scribes and
Pharisees came from Jerusalem
to learn wherein the power
of Jesus lay.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> But when they learned that
he and his disciples heeded not the
custom of the Jews, regarding washing
of the hands before they ate,
they were amazed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, Hypocrisy is
queen among you scribes and Pharisees.
Of you Isaiah wrote:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> This people honor me with
lips; their hearts are far away. In
vain they worship me; their doctrines
are the dogmas and the creeds
of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> You men who pose as men of
God, and still reject the laws of
God and teach the laws of men,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Stand forth and tell when
God gave unto men the ceremonial
laws that you observe; and tell these
people how the spirit life is sullied
if one washes not before he eats.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> His critics answered not, and
then he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Hear me, you men of Israel!
Defilement is a creature of the heart.
The carnal mind lays hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
thought, and makes a monstrous
bride; this bride is sin; sin is a creature
of the mind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> That which defiles a man is not
the food he eats.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The bread and fish and other
things we eat, are simply cups to
carry to the cells of flesh material
for the building of the human
house, and when their work is done
as refuse they are cast away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The life of plant and flesh
that goes to build the human house
is never food for soul. The spirit
does not feed upon the carcasses of
animal, or plant.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> God feeds the soul direct
from heaven; the bread of life comes
from above.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The air we breathe is charged
with Holy Breath, and he who wills
may take this Holy Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The soul discriminates, and
he who wants the life of Christ may
breathe it in. According to your
faith so let it be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Man is not a part of his abiding
place; the house is not the man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The lower world builds up
the house of flesh, and keeps it in
repair; the higher world provides
the bread of spirit life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The loveliest lilies grow from
stagnant ponds and filthiest muck.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The law of flesh demands
that one should keep the body
clean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The law of spirit calls for
purity in thought and word and
deed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Now, when the evening came
and they were in the house, the
twelve had many things to say, and
many questions to propound.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Nathaniel asked, Was what
you said about the house of flesh a
parable? If so, what does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, Can you not
yet discriminate? Do you not yet
perceive that what a man takes in
his mouth defiles him not?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> His food goes not into his
soul; it is material for flesh and bone
and brawn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> To spirit everything is clean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> That which defiles a man
wells up from carnal thoughts;
and carnal thoughts spring from
the heart, and generate a host of
evil things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> From out the heart comes
murders, thefts and foolishness. All
selfish acts and sensual deeds spring
from the heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> To eat with unwashed hands
does not defile the man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Peter said, Lord, What
you said today has grievously
offended scribe and Pharisee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Jesus said, These scribes
and Pharisees are not the scions of
the tree of life; they are not plants
of God; they are the plants of men,
and every foreign plant shall be
plucked up.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Let all these men alone; they
are blind guides; they lead a multitude
of people who are blind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The leaders and the led together
walk; together they will fall
into the yawning pits.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Jesus took the twelve and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">4</span> Then Jesus said, Behold, the

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Lo, I have taught that he who
counts his life of so much worth
that he would give it not in willing
sacrifice to save his brother man,
is worthy not to enter into life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Lo, I am come as pattern for
the sons of men, and I have not refrained
from helpfulness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> When I had passed the seven

life and all I had, to save the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> In the Judean wilderness I
fought the strongest foes of men,
and there I reaffirmed my consecration
to the service of my fellow man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> In troubles and in trials I have
wavered not; when false accusers
came, I answered not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> God gave the saving Word to
me, and I have often spoken it and
healed the sick, drove unclean
spirits out, and raised the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And I have shown you how
to speak the Word; and I have given
you the Word;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> In just a little while we turn
our faces toward Jerusalem, and
one of you who hear me now will
then betray me into wicked hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The scribes and Pharisees
will bring false charges up and hale
me into court, and, by consent of
Rome, I will be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Then Peter said, My Lord,
it shall not be. The Roman soldiers
will tread on twelve dead men
before they reach our Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But Jesus said, A savior of
the world cannot resist.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> I came to save the world and
I have taken up your names before
the highest courts of heaven, and
you have been confirmed as saviors
of the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And not a name, excepting
that of him who shall betray, will
ever be disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I go my way, and though
my flesh shall pass, my soul will
stand beside you all the way to
guide and bless.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And wicked men will seize
you in the streets, and as you kneel
in prayer; will charge you with
some legal crime, and think they
serve their God by putting you to
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> But falter not; the load will
heavy be, but with the consciousness
of duty done, the peace of
God will lift the load, dispel the pain
and light the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And we will meet where carnal
executioners come not; there
we will serve the cruel men, who in
their ignorance had tortured us to
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Can we prevent this outrage
and this slaughter of our lives? If
not we are but creatures of the ebb
and flow of carnal things. It would
not be a sacrifice of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But we are masters of the
things of time. Lo, we can speak,
and all the spirits of the fire, water,
earth and air will stand in our defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> We can command and many
legions of the angel world would
come and strike our enemies to
earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But it is best that not a
power of heaven or earth should
come to our relief. And it is best
that even God should veil his face
and seem to hear us not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> As I am pattern unto you,
so you are patterns for the human
race. We show by non-resistance
that we give our lives in willing
sacrifice for man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But my example will not
end with death. My body will be
laid within a tomb in which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
flesh has lain, symbolic of the purity
of life in death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And in the tomb I will remain
three days in sweet communion
with the Christ, and with my
Father-God, and Mother-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then, symbolic of the
ascent of the soul to higher life, my
flesh within the tomb will disappear;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Will be transmuted into
higher form, and, in the presence
of you all, I will ascend to God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Then Jesus and the twelve

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> in the night while the disciples
slept, lo, Jesus rose and
went alone into a mountain pass,
six miles away, to pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And in the morning when the
twelve awoke they could not find
the Lord, and all the people of the
village sought, and when the sun
had passed its highest point they
found him in the mountain pass.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And multitudes of people
came and brought their sick, and
Jesus taught and healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And when the night came on
the people would not go; they slept
upon the ground that they might
be a-near the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Three days and nights the
multitudes remained, and none had
aught to eat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus had compassion
and he said, If I should send the
multitudes away they might not
reach their homes, for they are
faint, for some have journeyed
many miles.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And his disciples said, Where
shall we get enough of food to feed
them all? There are four thousand
men, besides the women and the
little ones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, How many
loaves have you?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They answered, Seven, and
some little fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said, Go to, and
seat the people as you seated them
the other day when all the multitudes
were fed, in companies of
twelve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when the people were
sat down in companies of twelve
the loaves and fish were brought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus looked to heaven
and spoke the Word; and then he
broke the seven loaves in little bits,
and likewise cut the fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And every bit of bread became
a loaf, and every piece of fish
became a fish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The twelve went forth and
gave to every one; the people ate
and they were filled; and all the
fragments that were left were gathered
up, and there were seven baskets
full.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then the people went
their ways, and Jesus and the
twelve took boats and came to Dalmanatha
by the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Here they remained for many
days, and Jesus told the twelve
about the inner light that cannot
fail;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> About the kingdom of the
Christ within the soul; about the
power of faith; about the secret of
the resurrection of the dead; about
immortal life, and how the living
may go forth and help the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then they went into
their boats, and came unto the
northern coast of Galilee, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Chorazin where the kin of Thomas
lived, they left their boats and journeyed
on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> They came to Merom, where
the crystal waters seem to catch
the images of heaven and to reflect
the glory of the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And here they tarried certain
days in silent thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then they journeyed on,
and came into the land of Cæsarea-Philippi.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And as they walked and
talked among themselves, the master
said, What do the people say
about the son of man? who do they
think I am?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Matthew said, Some say
that you are David come again;
some say that you are Enoch, Solomon,
or Seth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Andrew said, I heard a
ruler of the synagogue exclaim,
This man is Jeremiah, for he speaks
like Jeremiah wrote.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Nathaniel said, The foreign
masters who were with us for a time,
declared that Jesus is Gautama
come again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> James said, I think that most
the master Jews believe you are the
reappearence of Elijah on the earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And John spoke out and said,
When we were in Jerusalem I heard
a seer exclaim, This Jesus is none
other than Melchizedek, the king of
peace, who lived about two thousand
years ago, and said that he
would come again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Thomas said, The Tetrarch
Herod thinks that you are
John arisen from the dead;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But then his conscience troubles
him; the spirit of the murdered
John looms up before him in his
dreams, and haunts him as a specter
of the night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And Jesus asked, Who do
you think I am?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Peter said, You are the
Christ, the love of God made manifest
to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Jesus said, Thrice blessed
are you, Simon, Jonas&#8217; son. You
have declared a truth that God has
given you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> You are a rock, and you shall
be a pillar in the temple of the Lord
of hosts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And your confession is the
cornerstone of faith, a rock of
strength, and on this rock the
Church of Christ is built.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Against it all the powers of
hades and of death cannot prevail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Behold, I give to you the
keys to open up the doors of safety
for the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> The Holy Breath will come

you shall stand before the nations

God requires of men as earnest

make known.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> Then turning to the twelve
he said, What you have heard this
day tell not to any man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
went up and were Susanna&#8217;s guests
for many days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> For seven days the master
and the twelve remained in Cæsarea-Philippi.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Then Jesus, taking Peter,
James and John, went forth unto a
mountain top to pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And as he prayed a brilliant
light appeared; his form became as
radiant as a precious stone;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> His face shone like the sun;
his garments seemed as white as
snow; the son of man became the
son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> He was transfigured that the
men of earth might see the possibilities
of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> When first the glory came
the three disciples were asleep; a
master touched their eyes and said,
Awake and see the glory of the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And they awoke, and saw
the glory of the Lord; and more,
they saw the glory of the heavenly
world, for they beheld two men
from thence stand forth beside the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Peter asked the master
who awakened them, Who are these
men who stand beside the Lord?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The master said, These men
are Moses and Elijah, who are come
that you may know that heaven
and earth are one; that masters
there and masters here are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The veil that separates the
worlds is but an ether veil. For
those who purify their hearts by
faith the veil is rolled aside, and
they can see and know that death
is an illusive thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Peter said, Praise God!
And then he called to Jesus and he
said, My master and my Lord, this
is the gate of heaven, and it is well
that we remain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> May we go down and bring
three tents; a tent for you, a tent
for Moses, and for Elijah one? But
Jesus answered not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Moses and Elijah talked
with Jesus on the mount. They
talked about the coming trial of the
Lord;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> About his death, his rest
within the tomb; about the wonders
of the resurrection morn; the transmutation
of his flesh, and his ascension
on the clouds of light;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And all symbolic of the path
that every man must tread; symbolic
of the way the sons of men
become the sons of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The three disciples were
amazed, and suddenly the ethers
were surcharged with song, and
forms as light as air, moved all
about the mountain top.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then from out the glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of the upper world they heard a
voice that said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> This is the son of man, my
chosen one to manifest the Christ
to men. Let all the earth hear him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> When the disciples heard the
voice they were afraid; they fell
upon the ground and prayed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Jesus came; he touched
them and he said, Arise, fear not;
lo, I am here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Then they arose, and as they
looked about they saw no one; the
men had gone. The master only
stood with them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> As Jesus and the three came
from the mountain top they talked
about the meaning of the scene, and
Jesus told them all; and then he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Till I have risen from the
dead tell not to any one what you
have seen.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> But the disciples could not
comprehend the meaning of the
words, Till I have risen from the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Jesus told them once
again about his death, and rising
from the grave; about the kingdom
of the soul that was to come in
glory and in power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> But Peter said, The scribes
have taught that e&#8217;er the king
shall come Elijah must appear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And Jesus said, Elijah has
already come; but scribes and Pharisees
received him not;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And men reviled him, bound
him, cast him in a prison cell, and
shouted with a fiend&#8217;s delight to see
him die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> What men have done to him,
that they will do to me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> Then the disciples understood

the people waited for the coming of
the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> When Jesus came the father
of the child knelt down before him
and implored his help.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He said, My master, I beseech
that you will look in pity on my son,
my only child; he is an epileptic
child and suffers grievously.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Sometimes he falls into the
fire and is burned; again he falls
into the water and is like to drown;
and many times a day he falls, he
grinds his teeth, the foam pours
from his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> I took my child to your disciples,
and they failed to give relief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And as he spoke a servant
brought the child before the Lord
(the child spoke not, for he was
dumb), and instantly he fell upon
the ground, he foamed, he writhed
in agony.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, How long has
he been troubled thus?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The father said, From infancy;
and we have sought in many lands
for help, but found it not; but I believe
that you can speak the Word
and heal my son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said, Faith is the
power of God. All things are possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
for him who in his heart believes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The father cried, in tears,
Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus spoke the Word of
power; the epileptic child lay in a
swoon; he did not breathe, and all
the people said, The child is dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But Jesus took him by the
hand and said: Arise; and he arose
and spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The people were amazed, and
many said, This surely is a man of
God, for no such power was ever
given to man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
went to the house, and after they
had taken food and been refreshed,
the nine disciples said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Lord, why could we not heal
this child? We spoke the Word;
but even that was powerless.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, Your great
success in all your former work has
made you careless, and you forgot
to recognize the power of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Without the spirit of the
Word, the Word is like an idle tale;
and you forgot to pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> There is no faith without the
prayer of faith. Faith is the wings
of prayer; but wings alone fly not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> By prayer and faith you can
bring down the mountain peaks,
and cast them in the sea; the little
hills will skip about like lambs at
your command.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> This failure may be well for
you. The greatest lessons that are
learned in life come through the
failures that are made.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> As the disciples sat in
thoughtful meditation Jesus said,
Let these words sink into your
hearts:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The time has nearly come
when you must bear your load alone;
that is, without my presence in the
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> For I will fall into the hands
of wicked men, and they will slay
me on a mount beyond Bezetha
wall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And men will lay my body
in a tomb where, by the sacred
Word, it will be guarded and preserved
three days; then I will rise
again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The twelve were sad; they
did not understand, and yet they
feared to ask him to reveal the
meaning of his word.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Next day the Christine master
and the twelve began their journey
of return, and soon were in
Capernaum.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_131">CHAPTER 131.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and Peter pay the half-shekel
tax. The disciples contend for the
supremacy. Jesus rebukes them.
Teaches them many practical lessons.
The parable of the good
shepherd.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">As</span> Jesus and the twelve were
resting in the house, the tax
collector came to Peter saying, Man,
do Jesus and yourself pay this half-shekel
tax?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Peter said, We pay whatever
is assessed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, From whom
do publicans collect this special
tax? from strangers or from native
sons?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Peter said, The strangers
only are supposed to pay this tax.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Then Jesus said, We all are
native sons and we are free; but lest
we cause contention we will pay the
tax; but neither had the shekel
wherewithal to pay.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus said, Go to the sea;
cast in a hook and catch a fish and
you will find within its inner parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
a shekel, which take up and pay the
tax for you and me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Peter did as Jesus said;
he found the shekel and he paid the
tax.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now Jesus heard the twelve
dispute among themselves. The
spirit of the carnal self was moving
in their hearts, and they were questioning
among themselves who was
the greatest in the sight of God and
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, You men, for
shame! the greatest is the servant
of the rest. And then he called to
him a little child; he took it in his
arms and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The greatest is the little
child, and if you would be great at
all you must become as is this child
in innocence, in truth, in purity in
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Great men scorn not the little
things of earth; he who regards and
honors such a child, regards and
honors me, and he who scorns a
child, scorn me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> If you would enter through
the kingdom gate you must be humble
as this little child.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Hear me, you men, This
child, as every other child, has one
to plead its cause before the throne
of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> You scorn it at your peril,
men, for lo, I say, its counterpart
beholds the face of God at every
moment, every day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And hear me once again, He
who shall cause a little one to stumble
and to fall is marked, accursed;
and it were better far if he had
drowned himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold, offenses everywhere!
Men find occasions for to sin and
fall, and they grow strong by rising
when they fall;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But woe to him who causes
other men to stumble and to fall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Be on your guard, you men
of God, lest you constrain another
man to fall; beware lest you fall into
sinful ways yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Now, if your hands cause you
to sin, you better cut them off; for
it is better far to have no hands and
not be guilty in the sight of God
and men, than to be perfect in your
form and lose your soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And if your feet should cause
offense, you better cut them off;
for it is better far to enter into life
without your feet than fall beneath
the curse.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And if your eyes, or ears,
cause you to sin, you better lose
them all than lose your soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Your thoughts and words
and deeds will all be tried by fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Remember that you are the
salt of earth; but if you lose the
virtues of the salt, you are but refuse
in the sight of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Retain the virtues of the salt
of life and be at peace among yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The world is full of men who
have not in themselves the salt of
life, and they are lost. I come to
seek and save the lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> How think you? if a shepherd
has a hundred sheep, and one of
them has gone astray, will he not
leave the ninety and the nine,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And go out in the desert
ways and mountain tops to seek the
one that went astray?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Yes, this you know; and if
he finds the one that went astray,
lo, he is glad, and he rejoices over it
far more than over all the ninety
and the nine that did not go astray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And so there is rejoicing in
the courts of heaven when one of
human birth who has gone forth
into the ways of sin is found and
brought back to the fold;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Yea, there is joy, more joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
than over all the righteous men who
never went astray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And John said, Master, who
may seek and save the lost? and
who may heal the sick, and cast
the demons out of those obsessed?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> When we were on the way
we saw a man who was not one of
us, cast demons out and heal the
sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> He did it by the sacred Word
and in the name of Christ; but we
forbade him, for he did not walk
with us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Jesus said, You sons of
men, do you imagine that you own
the powers of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And do you think that all
the world must wait for you to do
the works of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> God is not man that he
should have a special care for any
man, and give him special gifts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Forbid not any man to do
the works of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> There is no man who can
pronounce the sacred Word, and in
the name of Christ restore the sick,
and cast the unclean spirits out,
who is not child of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The man of whom you speak
is one with us. Whoever gathers
in the grain of heaven is one with
us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Whoever gives a cup of water
in the name of Christ is one with
us; so God shall judge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus defends a man who has been
convicted of stealing bread. The
verdict is reversed. The man goes
free, and the people supply the
needs of his starving family.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> multitude of people
thronged the streets. The
officers were on the way to court
with one, a man accused of stealing
bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And in a little while the man
was brought before the judge to
answer to the charge.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus and the twelve were
there. The man showed in his face
and hands the hard drawn lines of
toil and want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> A woman richly clad, the
accuser of the man, stood forth and
said, I caught this man myself; I
know him well, for yesterday he
came to beg for bread,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And when I drove him from
my door, he should have known
that I would harbor not a man like
him; and then today he came and
took the bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> He is a thief and I demand
that he be sent to jail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The servants also testified
against the man; he was adjudged
a thief, and officers were leading
him away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> But Jesus standing forth exclaimed,
You officers and judge, be
not in haste to lead this man away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Is this a land of justice and
of right? can you accuse and sentence
men to punishment for any
crime until they testify themselves?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The Roman law will not permit
such travesty on right, and I
demand that you permit this man
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And then the judge recalled
the man and said, If you have any
tale to tell, say on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> In tears the man stood forth
and said, I have a wife and little
ones and they are perishing for
bread, and I have told my story
oft, and begged for bread; but none
would hear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> This morning when I left
our cheerless hut in search of work
my children cried for bread, and I
resolved to feed them or to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> I took the bread, and I appeal
to God, Was it a crime?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> This woman snatched the
loaf away and threw it to the dogs,
and called the officers and I am here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Good people, do with me
whate&#8217;er you will, but save my wife
and little ones from death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Jesus said, Who is the
culprit in this case?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I charge this woman as a
felon in the sight of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> I charge this judge as criminal
before the bar of human rights.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I charge these servants and
these officers as parties to the crime.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> I charge the people of Capernaum
with cruelty and theft, because
they heeded not the cries of
poverty and want, and have withheld
from helpless ones that which
is theirs by every law of right;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And I appeal unto these people
here, and ask, Are not my
charges based on righteousness and
truth?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And every man said, Yes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The accusing woman blushed
for shame; the judge shrank back
in fear; the officers threw off the
shackles from the man and ran
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Then Jesus said, Give this
man what he needs and let him go
and feed his wife and little ones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The people gave abundantly;
the man went on his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, There is no
standard law to judge of crime. The
facts must all be stated e&#8217;er a judgment
can be rendered in a case.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> You men with hearts; go
forth and stand where stood this
man and answer me, What would
you do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> The thief thinks every other
man a thief and judges him accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The man who judges harshly
is the man whose heart is full of
crime.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The courtesan who keeps
her wickedness concealed by what
she calls respectability, has not a
word of pity for the honest courtesan
who claims to be just what she is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> I tell you, men, if you would
censure not till you are free from
sin, the world would soon forget the
meaning of the word, accused.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The twelve go to the feast in Jerusalem,
but Jesus remains in Capernaum.
He selects seventy disciples,

and heal. He goes alone to the
feast and on his way he heals ten

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> harvest feast drew near;
the twelve went to Jerusalem,
but Jesus did not go with them; he
tarried in Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Among the multitudes that
followed him were many who went
not up to the feast; they were not
Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus called three-score-and-ten
of these disciples unto him
and said, The kingdom of the Christ
is not for Jews alone; it is for every
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Lo, I have chosen twelve to
preach the gospel, first unto the
Jews; and they are Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Twelve is the number of the
Jew and seven the number of the

but unto every nation under heaven;
to Greek and to Assyrian; to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Samaritan; to those beyond the
seas; to every man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> You need not go afar, for men
of every land are here and in Samaria.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Arise and go your way; but
go in faith; and take no gold nor
silver in your purse; no extra coat
or shoes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Go in the sacred name; trust
God and you will never come to
want.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And let this be your salutation
everywhere, Peace be to all;
good will to all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And if the son of peace be in
the house, the door will open wide
and you will enter in; and then the
holy peace will rest upon that house.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The seventy in twos went
forth; they went into Samaria, and
as they went they said, Peace be to
all; good will to all!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Repent and turn from sin,
and set your house in order, for a
son of man who bears the image of
the Christ, will come, and you may
see his face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They entered every village
of Samaria; they preached in Tyre
and in Sidon by the sea. Some
went to Crete, and others into
Greece, and others went to Gilead
and taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus, all alone, went
to the feast by the Samaria way;
and as he went through Sychar
on the way, the lepers saw him
and a company of ten called from
afar and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Lord Jesus, stay and speak
the Word for us that we may be
made clean.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said, Go forth and
show yourselves unto the priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They went, and as they went
their leprosy was healed. One of
the ten, a native of Samaria, returned
to thank the master and to
praise the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said to him, Lo,
ten were cleansed; where are the
nine? Arise, and go your way;
your faith has made you whole.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> You have revealed your
heart and shown that you are
worthy of the power; behold the
nine will find again their leprous
hands and feet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus went his way, and
while the feast was on he came into
Jerusalem, and went into the temple
courts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And he rebuked the scribes
and Pharisees, the priests and doctors
of the law for their hypocrisy
and selfishness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The common people were
amazed; they said, From whence
has come the wisdom of this man?
he speaks as speaks a sage.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, I did not
learn the wisdom of the Holy One
within the schools of men; my teaching
is not mine; I speak the words
of him who sent me here to do his
will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> If any man would know
whereof I speak, lo, he must do the
will of God. No man can know
except he enters into life and does
the will of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Now, Moses gave the law;
but none of you have kept the law;
how can you judge the worthiness
of any man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Once in these courts I healed
a man upon a Sabbath day, and in
a rage you sought to take my life;
and now because I tell the truth
you seek again to take my life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> A scribe spoke out and said,
You foolish man, you are obsessed;
who wants to take your life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The common people said,
Is this not Jesus whom the rulers
long have sought to kill? and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
he comes and teaches in the temple
courts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> If he is guilty of such monstrous
crimes, why do they not take
him away in chains?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, You all
know me, and know from whence I
came; but you know not the God
who sent me here, whose words I
speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The multitudes again stood
forth in his defense; they said, If
this is not the Christ whom God has
promised to reveal to men, will he
do greater works when he shall
come than does this man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> The Pharisees and ruling
priests were angered and they sent
their officers to take him e&#8217;er he
went away. The officers were filled
with fear; they seized him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And Jesus said, Lo, I am
here but for a little time and then I
go my way to him who sent me
here to do his will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> You seek me now and you
can find me now; the time will come
when you will seek and will not find,
for where I go you cannot come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The people said, Where will
he go that men can find him not?
Will he go forth to Greece and teach
the Greeks? or will he go to Egypt
or Assyria to teach?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> But Jesus answered not; unnoticed
by the multitudes he left
the temple courts and went his way.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> on the last day of the

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And others said, He cannot

from Bethlehem where David lived.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Again the priests and Pharisees
sent officers to bring him into

the officers returned and brought
him not,</p>

said, Why did you not arrest this

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The officers replied, We never
heard a man speak like this man

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> In rage the Pharisees stood
forth and said, Have you gone mad?
Have you been led astray? Are
you disciples of this man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Have any of the rulers, or
the Pharisees believed on him? The
common people! yes, they may believe;
they are accursed; they know
not anything.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But Nicodemus came before
the rulers and he said, Can Jewish
judges judge a man and sentence
him until they hear his plea? Let
Jesus stand before this bar and testify
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">14</span> The rulers said, This Jesus
is a wily man, and if we suffer him
to speak, he will rebuke us face to
face, and then the multitudes will
laugh and stand in his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then you know, as well
as we, that prophets do not come
from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The rulers felt the force of
what the officers and Nicodemus
said, and they said nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And then the people went
their way, each to his home; but
Jesus went unto Mount Olives where
he spent the night in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But in the morning when the
sun had scarcely risen, Jesus came
again, and many people came to see
him in the temple courts, and he sat
down and taught the multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The Pharisees and scribes
were still alert to find a cause whereby
they might condemn him by the
words he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The officers had taken in the
very act of crime, a courtesan. As
Jesus taught, they brought this
woman in and set her in the midst
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Rabboni, this vile woman
has been taken in adultery. The
law of Moses says that such as she
shall die, be stoned to death; what
do you say should be her punishment?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus stooped and made
a figure on the ground and in it
placed the number of a soul, and
then he sat in silent thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And when the priests demanded
that he speak, he said, Let
him who has no sin stand forth and
be the first to cast a stone at her.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he closed his eyes,
and not a word was said. When he
arose and saw the woman all alone
he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Where are the men who
brought you here? they who accused?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The woman said, They all
are gone; no one was here who could
condemn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, And I condemn
you not; go on your way in
peace, and sin no more.</p>

Behold the light! and he who follows
me shall not walk in the dark,
but he shall have the light of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> A lawyer said, You witness
for yourself, your witness is not

me not or you would know my
Father, and if you knew the Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
you would know the son, because
the Father and the son are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> I go my way and you shall
find me not; for where I go you cannot
come, because you do not know
the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> You cannot find the way because
your hearts are gross, your

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The light of life cannot shine
through the murky veil that you
have drawn about your hearts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> You do not know the Christ

you will dwell in darkness and in the
shadow of the grave till you believe

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> But you will vilify the son
of man, and lift him up and laugh
to see him die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> But then a little light will
come and you will know that I am
what I am.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The people did not comprehend
the meaning of the words he
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then he spoke unto the
people who believed in him and said,
If you abide in Christ, and Christ
abide in you, and if you keep my
words within your heart,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> You are the way, you are
disciples in the way, and you shall
know what is the truth, and truth
shall make you free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And still the people did not
understand; they said, We are the
seed of Abraham and are already
free; we never were the slaves of any
man; why do you say, We shall be
free?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, Do you not
know that every one committing
sin is slave of sin? abides in bondage
unto sin?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> If you sin not then you are
free; but if you sin in thought, or
word, or deed, then you are slaves,
and naught but truth can set you
free; if you are free through Christ,
then you are free indeed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> You are the seed of Abraham,
and yet you seek to kill me just because
I speak the truth of Abraham.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> You are the children of the
flesh of Abraham; but, lo, I say,
There is a spiritual Abraham whom
you know not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> In spirit you are children of
your father, and your father is Diabolus;
you hang upon his words and
do his will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> He was a murderer from the
first; he cannot tell the truth, and
when he tells a lie he speaks his own;
he is himself a lie, and he is father
of himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> If you were children of my
Father-God, then you could hear
the words of God; I speak the words
of God, but you can hear them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> A Pharisee stood forth and
said, This fellow is not one of us;
he is a curst Samaritan and is obsessed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> But Jesus heeded not the
words of Pharisee or scribe; he knew
that all the people knew he was a
Jew.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And then he said, Whoever
keeps my words shall never die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> A lawyer said, And now we
know he is obsessed. Our father
Abraham is dead; the prophets all
are dead, and yet this fellow says,
Whoever keeps my words shall never

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Is this man greater than our
father Abraham? Is he above the
prophets? and all of them are dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Jesus said, Your father
Abraham rejoiced to see my day;
he saw it and was glad.</p>

the way.</p>

that way; he saw the wounded man;
but then he had no time to lose; he
passed by on the other side.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A Levite came and saw the
man; but he was loath to soil his
sacerdotal robes, and he passed by.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> A lawyer on his way to Jericho

then he said, If I could make a
shekel I might help the man; but he
has nothing left to give, I have no
time for charity; and he passed on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then a stranger from
Samaria came that way; he saw the
wounded man; his heart was
touched with pity and he stopped,
dismounted from his horse,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Revived the man, and placed
him on his horse and took him to
an inn and charged the keeper of
the inn to nurse him back to
strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> He gave the keeper all the
money that he had and said, Your
charges may be more than this, but
care for this unfortunate, and when
I come again I will pay all; and then
he went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, master of the law,
which of these four was neighbor

thieves?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The lawyer said, The man
who showed him mercy; he who
cared for him.</p>

you need not trouble so about the

her bread.</p>

firmly and you shall receive; seek
trustingly and you shall find; knock
earnestly, the door will open up.</p>

pay off the debts of other men when
by the Word we heal them, drive the
unclean spirits out, or rescue them
from any form of sore distress?</p>

pay the debts of any man, but by
the Word we may release a man
from his afflictions and distress,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And make him free, that he
may pay the debts he owes, by giving
up his life in willing sacrifice for
men, or other living things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Behold, we may make free
this man that he may better serve

he said, Go to Siloam and wash, and
as you wash say, <i>Jahhevahe</i>. This

he washed his eyes and spoke
the word, and instantly his eyes
were opened and he saw.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The people who had seen the

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> He said, A man whom men
call Jesus, made a salve of clay and

a word and wash in Siloam seven
times; I did as he commanded me,

made of clay; he bade me say a word
and bathe my eyes in water seven

saw.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> A lawyer asked the man,
Who was it opened up your eyes?</p>

say, His name is Jesus and that
he came from Galilee; but others
say, He is the son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> A Pharisee came up and said,
This is the Sabbath day; a man who
does a work like this, regarding not
the Sabbath day, is not from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Some of the priests were
much amazed and said, A wicked
man could never do a miracle like
this; he must possess the power of
God. And so they strove among
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> They asked the man, What
do you think about this man from
Galilee?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> He said, He is a prophet sent
from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Now, many of the Jews did
not believe the man was blind from
birth; they said, There is no power
to open up the eyes of one born
blind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And then they brought the
parents of the man before the Pharisees
that they might testify.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> They said, This is our son
who was born blind; we do not
know how he received his sight; he
is of age and he can tell; ask him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> They were afraid to say what
they believed, that Jesus is the
Christ who came to manifest the
power of God, lest they offend the
priests and be cast from the synagogue.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Again the rulers said, This
Jesus is a wicked man. The man
who had been healed stood forth
again and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> This Jesus may be sinner or
be saint, I do not know; but this one
thing I know; I once was blind, but
now I see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> And then the scribes and
Pharisees reviled the man and said,
You are a follower of this man from
Galilee. We follow Moses, but this
man, we know him not, and know
not whence he is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> The man replied, It is a marvel
that you know not whence he is,
and yet he opened up my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> You know that nothing but
the power of God can do such things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> God hears not sinners pray,
and you must know that he is not a
wicked man who can employ the
power of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> The Pharisees replied, You

born in sin, and now you try to
teach the law to us. And then they
cast him from the synagogue.</p>

through the gate into the fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The sheep know not a
stranger&#8217;s voice; they will not follow
him; they flee away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The people did not understand
the parable that Jesus spoke;
and then he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Christ is the gateway of the
fold; I am the shepherd of the sheep,
and he who follows me through
Christ shall come into the fold
where living waters flow, and where
rich pastures are.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> False prophets come and go;
they claim to be the shepherds of
the sheep; they claim to know the
way, but they know not the word
of power; the watchman opens not
the gate; the sheep heed not their
call.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The shepherd of the sheep
will give his life to save the sheep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> A hireling flees to save his
life when wolves infest the fold;
and then the tender lambs are
snatched away, the sheep are scattered
everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> I am the shepherd of the
sheep; I know the sheep of God;
they know my voice, as God knows
me and I know him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The Father loves me with a
deathless love, because I lay my
life down for the sheep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> I lay my life down when I
will, but I may take it up again; for
every son of God by faith has power
to lay his mortal flesh aside and take
it up again. These words I have
received from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Again the people strove
among themselves; they were divided
in their views concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Christ. They could not comprehend
the words that Jesus spoke.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Some said again, He is obsessed,
or he is mad; why listen to
his words?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And others said, His words
are not the words of one obsessed.
Can unclean spirits open up the
eyes of one born blind?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Then Jesus left Jerusalem
and with Massalian he tarried certain
days.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_140">CHAPTER 140.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and the three disciples return
to Capernaum. Jesus receives the
report of the seventy. With his
disciples he goes through all Galilee
encouraging the believers. He
heals a woman. Relates the parable
of the little seed and the great
tree.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> time had come for the return
of the three score and ten
whom Jesus sent abroad to preach.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus, Peter, James and
John began their journey back to
Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They went up through Samaria;
they passed through many
villages and towns, and everywhere
the people thronged the ways to see
the man the seventy had told
about; and Jesus taught and healed
the sick.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And when they reached Capernaum
the seventy were there; and
they were filled with joy; they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The Spirit of the Lord of
hosts was with us all the way, and
we were filled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The power of the sacred Word
was manifest in us; we healed the
sick; we caused the lame to walk,
the deaf to hear, the blind to see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The very devils trembled
when we spoke the Word, and they
were subject unto us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, As you were
going on your way, the heavens
were bright with light, the earth
was bright, they seemed to meet and
be at one; and I beheld, and Satan
fell as lightning from the heavens.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold, for you have power
to tread on serpents and on scorpions,
and these are symbols of the
enemies of men. You are protected
in the way of right, and naught can
harm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And as you went I heard a
master say, Well done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But you may not rejoice because
you have the power to heal
the sick and make the devils tremble
by the Word; for such rejoicing
is from carnal self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> You may rejoice because the
nations of the earth have ears to
hear the Word, and eyes to see the
glory of the Lord, and hearts to feel
the inner breathing of the Holy
Breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And you may well be glad
because your names are written in
the Book of Life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Then Jesus looked to heaven
and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord
of heaven and earth, because thou
hast revealed thyself to babes, and
taught them how to light the path
and lead the wise to thee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> What thou hast given to me,
lo, I have given to them, and
through the sacred Word I have bestowed
on them the understanding
heart,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> That they might know and
honor thee through Christ, who was,
and is, and evermore shall be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And then he said aside, unto
the seventy and twelve, Most blessed
are your eyes because you see the
things you see;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And blessed are your ears
because they hear the things they
hear;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">19</span> And blessed are your hearts
because you understand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> In ages that are gone the wise
of earth, the prophets, seers and
kings, desired to hear and see and
know what you have heard and seen
and known; but they had not attained
and could not hear, and see
and know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said again, Lo, I
have gone before you many moons,
and I have given to you the bread
of heaven and the cup of life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Have been your buckler and
your stay; but now that you have
learned the way, and have the
strength to stand alone, behold, I
lay my body down and go to him
who is the All.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> In forty days then we will
turn our faces toward Jerusalem
where I will find the altar of the
Lord and give my life in willing sacrifice
for men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Let us arise and go through
all the coasts of Galilee, and give a
salutation of good cheer to all the
sons of God by faith.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And they arose and went;
they entered every town and village
on the coast, and everywhere they
said, The benedictions of the Christ
abide with you forevermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Now, in a certain town they
went up to the synagogue upon the
Sabbath day, and Jesus taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And as he spoke, two men
brought on a cot a woman bent
near double with disease; she had
not risen from her bed for eighteen
years without a helping hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Jesus laid his hand upon
the woman, and he said, Arise, be
free from your infirmity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And as he spoke the Word
the woman found that she was
straight and strong, and she arose
and walked and said, Praise God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The ruler of the synagogue
was filled with wrath because the
healer healed upon the Sabbath
day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> He did not censure Jesus
face to face, but turning to the
multitudes he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> You men of Galilee, why do
you break the laws of God? There
are six days in every week when
you may work, and then you may
bring the afflicted to be healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> This is the day that God has
blessed, the Sabbath day in which
men may not work.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Jesus said, You inconsistent
scribes and Pharisees! Upon
the Sabbath day you take your
beasts of burden from their stalls,
and lead them forth to eat and
drink; is this not work?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> This daughter of your father
Abraham, who has been bound for
eighteen years, has come in faith
to be made free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Now, tell me, men, is it a
crime to break her bonds and set
her free upon the Sabbath day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> The ruler said no more; the
people all rejoiced and said, Behold
the Christ!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And Jesus spoke a parable;
he said, The kingdom of the Christ
is like a little seed that one put in
the ground;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> It grew and after many years
became a mighty tree, and many
people rested in its shade, and birds
built nests and reared their young
among its leafy boughs.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_141">CHAPTER 141.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus speaks words of encouragement.
Rebukes an officious Pharisee.

dropsical man. Rebukes guests

parable of a wedding feast.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">And</span> Jesus went into another
town upon the coast and spoke
good words of cheer to those who
followed him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And one stood forth and said,
Lord, are there few that enter into
life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, The way is
rough that leads to life; the gate is
narrow and is guarded well; but
every one who seeks in faith shall
find the way, and they who know
the Word may enter in.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> But many seek the way for
selfish gain; they pound upon the
gate of life; but it is fast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The watchman from the turret
says, I know you not; your speech
is that of Ashdod, and your robes
are those of sin; depart and go your
way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And they will go their way
with weeping and with gnashing
of the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And they will be enraged
when they see their father Abraham
with Isaac, Jacob and the prophets,
resting in the kingdom of the Christ,
and they themselves debarred.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And, lo, I say that men will
come from lands afar, from east,
from west, from north, from south
and sit with me in consciousness of
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Behold, I say, the last shall
be the first, the first shall be the last.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> All men are called unto the
kingdom of the Christ; but few are
chosen, for the pure in heart alone
can see the king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And as he spoke a Pharisee
came up and said, You man of Galilee,
if you would save your life remain
not here; flee instantly, for
Herod swears that he will take your
life, and even now his officers are
seeking you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus said, Why is it
that the Pharisees are so concerned
about my life? And then he said
unto the man who spoke,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Go forth and say to that sly
fox, Behold, I heal the sick and cast
the unclean spirits out today, tomorrow,
and the days to come, and
then I will attain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Go say to him, I need not
fear in Galilee, for I must meet the
cruel wrath of men within Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And while they tarried in
the place a man, a Pharisee, invited
Jesus and a few of those who followed
him, to dine with him upon
the Sabbath day, to celebrate the
marriage of his son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Among the guests was one
afflicted with a dropsical disease.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said to those who
had been sent to get from his own
lips some words by which they
might accuse him of a crime,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> You lawyers and you Pharisees,
what do you say about the lawlessness
of healing on the Sabbath
day? Here is a man, one of your
own, and he is sore distressed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Shall I, in God&#8217;s own
strength, say out the healing Word
and heal this man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The lawyers and the Pharisees
were dumb; they answered not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then Jesus spoke the healing
Word and healed the man and he,
rejoicing, went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Then Jesus said again unto
the lawyers and the Pharisees,
Which one of you who has a horse
or cow, if it would fall into a pit
upon the Sabbath day would not
call in his friends to help to draw
it out?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And not a man could answer,
Here am I.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> As Jesus looked upon the
guests who had been bidden to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
feast and saw them crowding in
to get the highest seats, he said
to them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> You selfish men why do you
strive to take the highest seats
when you are but invited guests?
You do not show our host the courtesies
of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> When men are bidden to a
marriage feast they should sit in the
lower seats until the host shall place
them where he wills.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> You may, unbidden, take
the highest seat; but then a man
more honorable may come and when
the host shall bid you rise and take
a lower seat that he may honor his
more worthy guest, you cannot help
but blush for very shame in your
humility.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But if you take the lowest
seat and then are honored by your
host and asked to take a higher seat,
you are esteemed an honored
guest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> In this event we note a principle
in life, That he who would exalt
himself shall be abased, and he
who humbles low himself shall be
exalted in the sight of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Then Jesus spoke to all the
guests; he said, When any one of
you would make a feast it should
not be for friends, or kindred, or the
rich;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> For they consider such a
courtesy loaned out, and they feel
called upon to make a greater feast
for you, just in the payment of a
debt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> But when you make a feast
invite the poor, the lame, the blind;
in this a blessing waits for you, for
well you know that you will get
naught in return; but in the consciousness
of helping those who
need, you will be recompensed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And then he spoke a parable:
he said, A wealthy man prepared a
feast; he sent his servants forth to
bid his chosen ones to come; but
they desired not to go, and they
formed such excuses as they thought
would satisfy the would-be host.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> One said, I have just bought
a piece of land, and I must go and
prove my title to the land; I pray
to be excused.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Another said, I must go down
and prove my ownership in sheep
that I have bought; I pray to be
excused.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Another said, I have been
married but a little time and so I
cannot go; I beg to be excused.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Now, when the servants came
and told the man who had prepared
the feast that those he had invited
would not come,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The man was grieved in
heart; and then he sent his servants
forth into the streets and alleys of
the town to bring up to the feast
the poor, the lame, the blind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The servants went abroad
and found the poor, the lame, the
blind, and brought them in; but
there was room for more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> The host then sent his men
of arms to bring by force the people
to his feast; and then the house was
full.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> And God has made a feast
for men. Long years ago he sent
his servants forth unto the favored
sons of men. They would not hear
his call; they came not to the
feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> He then sent forth his servants
to the strangers and the multitudes;
they came, but there is
room for more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> Behold, for he will send his
angels forth with mighty trumpet
blast, and men will be compelled
to come up to the feast.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Jesus and the twelve went
to another town, and as they
entered it they said, Peace be to all;
good will to all.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A multitude of people followed
and the master said to them,
Behold, for you are followers for
selfish gain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> If you would follow me in
love, and be disciples of the Holy
Breath, and gain at last the crown
of life, you must leave all there is of
carnal life behind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Be not deceived; stay, men,
and count the cost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> If one would build a tower, or
a home, he first sits down and
counts the cost to be assured that
he has gold enough to finish it.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> For well he knows that if he
makes a failure of his enterprise he
may lose all his wealth, and be the
butt of ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And if a king desires to take

calls his trusted men and they consider
well their strength; he will not
measure arms with one of matchless

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Count well the cost before you
start to follow me; it means the
giving up of life, and all you have.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> If you love father, mother,
wife, or child, more than you love
the Christ, you cannot follow me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> If you love wealth or honor
more than you love the Christ, you
cannot follow me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The paths of carnal life do
not run up the mountain side towards
the top; they run around the
mount of life, and if you go straight
to the upper gate of consciousness
you cross the paths of carnal life;
tread in them not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And this is how men bear the
cross; no man can bear another&#8217;s
cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Take up your cross and follow
me through Christ into the
path of true discipleship; this is the
path that leads to life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> This way of life is called the
pearl of greatest price, and he who
finds it must put all he has beneath
his feet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Behold, a man found in a
certain field the croppings of a wondrous
mine of gold, and he went
forth and sold his home and all he
had and bought the field; then he
rejoiced in wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Now, there were present,
scribes and Pharisees of wealth who
loved their money, and their bonds
and lands, and they laughed loud
to scorn what Jesus said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Jesus spoke to them
and said, You are the men who
justify yourselves in sight of men;
God knows your wickedness of
heart;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And you must know, O
men, that whatsoever is revered and
is exalted by the carnal mind, is an
abomination in the sight of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus went his way, and
as he went a young man ran and
knelt down at his feet and said,
Good master, tell me what to do
that I may have eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, Why do you
call me good? No one is truly
good but God himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And God has said, If you
would enter into life, keep the
Commandments of the law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The young man asked, To
which commands did he refer?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, You shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
not kill; you shall not steal; you
shall not do adulterous things; you
shall not falsely testify;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And you shall love your God
with all your heart, and you shall
love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The man replied, These
things I have observed from youth;
what lack I yet?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, One thing
you lack; your heart is fixed on
things of earth; you are not free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Go forth and sell all that you
have, and give your money to the
poor, and come and follow me,
and you shall have eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The man was grieved at
what the master said; for he was
rich; he hid his face and went in
sorrow on his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Jesus looked upon the
sorrowing man and said, It is so
hard for men with hoarded wealth
to enter through the door into the
kingdom of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And his disciples were
amazed at what he said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> He answered them and said,
I tell you, men, that they who trust
in riches cannot trust in God and
cannot come into the kingdom of
the soul;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Yea, it is easier for a camel
to go through a needle&#8217;s eye than
for a man with hoarded wealth to
find the way of life. And his
disciples said, Who then can find
the way? Who can be saved?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, The rich
may give his gold away; the high
may kiss the dust, and God will
save.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> Then Jesus spoke this parable
to them:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> A rich man lived in splendid
state; he wore the finest garments
men could make; his boards were
loaded with the costliest viands of
the land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> A beggar, blind and lame,
whose name was Lazarus, was wont
to sit beside the waste gate of this
home that he might share with
dogs the refuse from the rich man&#8217;s
boards.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> It came to pass that Lazarus
died, and angels carried him away
unto the bosom of our father
Abraham.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The rich man also died, and
he was buried in a costly tomb;
but in the purifying fires he opened
up his eyes dissatisfied.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> He looked and saw the beggar
resting peacefully in the bosom
of his father Abraham, and in the
bitterness of his soul he cried,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> My father Abraham, look
down in mercy on your son; I am
tormented in these flames.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Send Lazarus, I beseech,
that he may give me just a sup of
water to cool my parched tongue.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> But Abraham replied, My
son, in mortal life, you had the best
things of the earth and Lazarus
had the worst, and you would not
give him a cup of water there, but
drove him from your door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> The law must be fulfilled,
and Lazarus now is comforted, and
you are paying what you owe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> Besides, there is a great gulf
fixed between your zone and us,
and if I would I could not send
Lazarus to you, and you cannot
come up to us till you have paid
your debts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> Again the man in anguish
said, O father Abraham, I pray,
send Lazarus back to earth, and to
my father&#8217;s house, that he may tell
my brothers who are yet in life,
for I have five of them, about the
horrors of this place, lest they come
down to me and not to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> And Abraham replied, They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
have the words of Moses and the
seers, let them hear them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> The man replied, They will
not hearken to the written word;
but if a man would go up from the
grave they might believe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> But Abraham replied, If
they hear not the words of Moses
and the seers they would not be
persuaded even though one from
the dead stood in their midst.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> And Peter said, Lord, we
have left our all to follow you; and
what is our reward?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> And Jesus said, Most verily
I say to you, that you who have left

<p class="hang"><i>Righteousness in rewards. Jesus relates
the parable of the husbandman
and the laborers. Makes
known the divine law of divorce.
The mystery of marriage.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord was standing by the
sea; the multitudes were there
and one stood forth and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Does God bestow rewards as
men bestow rewards, for what is
done?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, Men never
know what other men have done,
this life is such a seeming life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> One man may seem to do a
mighty work, and be adjudged by
men as worthy of a great reward.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Another man may seem to be
a failure in the harvest fields of
life, and be dishonored in the face
of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Men do not know the hearts
of men; God only knows the hearts
of men, and when the day is done
he may reward with life the man
who fell beneath the burdens of the
day, and turn away the man who
was the idol of the hearts of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then he spoke a parable;
he said, The kingdom of the soul is
like a man who had a vast estate,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And in the morning time he
went down to the market place to
search for men to gather in his
grain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> He found three men, and he
agreed to give to each a penny for
his service for the day, and sent
them to his field.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Again he went down to the
market place the third hour of the
day and found five men in waiting,
and he said, Go down into my field
and serve, and I will pay you what
is right; and they went down and
served.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He went again; it was the
sixth hour of the day, and seven
men were waiting at the stand; he
sent them to the field to serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And at the eleventh hour
he went again; twelve men stood
there in seeming idleness; he said to
them, Why stand you here in idleness
all day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> They said, Because we have
no work to do; no man has hired us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then he sent them to his
field to serve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, when the evening came
the man said to his steward, Call
the laborers from the field, and pay
them for his services. And all
were paid, and each received a
penny for his hire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Now, when the twelve, who
served but from the eleventh hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
received each one a penny for his
hire, the three were sore aggrieved;
they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> These twelve have served
but one short hour, and now they
have an equal share with us who
have toiled through the scorching
hours of day; should we not have
at least two pennies for our hire?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The man replied, My friends,
I do no wrong to you. Did we
not have a fast agreement when
you went to work? have I not
paid in full?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> What is it unto you if I
should pay these men a smaller or
a larger sum? Take that which is
your own and go your way, for I
will give unto the twelve what I
will give unto the three, the five,
the seven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> They did their best and you
could do no more than do your best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The hire of man is based
upon the intent of the heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> As Jesus taught, a Pharisee
came up and said, Lord, is it lawful
for a man to put away his wife?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus said, You ought
to know; what says the law?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The Pharisee replied, The
law provides that man may be divorced,
may put away his wife.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Jesus said, The hardness
of the hearts of men induced the
giver of the law to make provisions
such as these; but from the first it
was not so.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> God made a woman for a
man, and they were one; and afterwards
he said, A man shall leave his
father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife; they are no
more divided; they are one, one
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> What God has joined no man
can part.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Now, when they went up to
the house, a man made free to ask
again about this matter of divorce.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Jesus said again what
to the Pharisee he said; and then he
gave the higher law of marriage
life:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Whoever puts away his wife,
except she be a courtesan, and then
shall take another wife commits
adultery.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The woman who shall leave
a man, unless he be a libertine and
an adulterer, and then becomes the
wife of any other man, commits
adultery.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Thomas asked, What is
adultery?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, The man
who harbors lustful thoughts, who
covets any woman not his wife, is an
adulterer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The wife who harbors lustful
thoughts, and covets any man who
is not wed to her, is not her husband,
is a courtesan.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Men cannot make a law to
bind two hearts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> When two are bound in love
they have no thought of lust. The
woman cannot leave the man; the
man has no desire to send his wife
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> When men and women harbor
lustful thoughts, and covet any
other flesh, they are not one, not
joined by God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And Philip said, Lord, are
there few that God has joined in
holy marriage bonds?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And Jesus said, God knows
the pure in heart; the lustful men
and women are but creatures of the
lustful self; they cannot be at one;
nor can they be at one with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Nathaniel said, Is it not well
that all men should refrain from
taking on themselves the marriage
vow?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> And Jesus said, Men are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
pure because they are unmarried
men. The man who lusts is an
adulterer if he has wife or not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> And then he said to all,
Some things men know by being
told, while other things they know
not till the gate of consciousness
shall open up for them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> I speak a mystery that now
you cannot understand; but you
shall some day understand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> A eunuch is a man who does
not lust; some men are eunuchs
born, some men are eunuchs by
the power of men, and some are
eunuchs by the Holy Breath, who
makes them free in God through
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> He who is able to receive the
truth I speak, let him receive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines at Tiberius. Jesus
speaks on the inner life. Relates
the parable of the prodigal son.
The resentment of the elder brother.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">When</span> they had journeyed
through the towns and cities
of the land of Galilee, the Lord with
his disciples came to Tiberius,
and here they met a few who loved
the name of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus told them many
things about the inner life; but when
the multitudes came up, he spoke
a parable; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> A certain man with great possessions
had two sons. The youngest
son grew tired of life at home
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> My father, pray divide your
wealth and give the portion that is
mine to me, and I will seek my
fortune in another land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The father did as he desired,
and with his wealth the young man
went into a foreign land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> He was a profligate and soon
had squandered all his wealth in
ways of sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> When nothing else remained
for him to do he found employment
in the fields to care for swine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And he was hungry and no
one gave him aught to eat, and so
he ate the carob pods that he was
feeding to the swine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And after many days he found
himself and said unto himself, My
father is a man of wealth; he has a
score of servants who are bountifully
fed while I, his son, am starving
in the fields among the swine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> I do not hope to be received
again as son, but I will rise and go
straight to my father&#8217;s house, and
I will make confession of my waywardness;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And I will say, My father, I
am come again; I am a profligate,
and I have lost my wealth in ways
of sin; I am not worthy to be called
your son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> I do not ask to be received
again as son, but let me have a
place among your servants, where
I may have a shelter from the
storms and have enough to eat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And he arose and sought his
father&#8217;s house, and as he came his
mother saw him while yet a great
way off.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> (A mother&#8217;s heart can feel
the first faint yearning of a wandering
child.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The father came, and hand
in hand they walked a-down the
way to meet the boy, and there was
joy, great joy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The boy tried hard to plead
for mercy and a servant&#8217;s place;
but love was all too great to listen
to the plea.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The door was opened wide;
he found a welcome in the mother&#8217;s
heart, and in the father&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The father called the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in, and bade them bring the
finest robe for him; the choicest
sandals for his feet; a ring of purest
gold for him to wear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the father said,
My servants, go and kill the fatted
calf; prepare a feast, for we are
glad;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Our son we thought was
dead is here alive; a treasure that
we thought was lost is found.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The feast was soon prepared
and all were merry, when the eldest
son who had been serving in a distant
field and knew not that his
brother had returned, came home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And when he learned the
cause of all the merriment he was
offended, and would not go into the
house.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> His father and his mother
both besought him tearfully to disregard
the waywardness and folly
of their son; but he would not; he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Lo, all these years I have remained
at home, have served you
every day, have never yet transgressed
your most severe commands;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And yet you never killed for
me a kid, nor made for me a simple
feast that I might make merry with
my friends;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> But when your son, this
profligate, who has gone forth and
squandered half your wealth in
ways of sin, comes home, because
he could do nothing else, you kill
for him the fatted calf and make a
wondrous feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> His father said, My son, all
that I have is yours and you are
ever with us in our joys;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And it is well to show our
gladness when your brother, who
is near and dear to us, and who we
thought was dead, returns to us
alive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> He may have been a profligate;
may have consorted with gay
courtesans and thieves, yet he is
still your brother and our son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Then Jesus said so all might
hear: He who has ears to hear, and
hearts to understand will comprehend
the meaning of this parable.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
came to Capernaum.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_145">CHAPTER 145.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus speaks on the establishment of
the Christine kingdom and the future
coming of the Lord in power.
Exhorts to faithfulness. Parable
of the unjust judge. Parable of
the Pharisee and the publican.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> company of Pharisees came
up to speak with Jesus and
they said, Rabboni, we have heard
you say, The kingdom is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> We read in Daniel that the
God of heaven will form a kingdom,
and we ask, Is this the kingdom of
the God you speak about? If so,
when will it come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, The prophets
all have told about this kingdom of
the God, and it is just at hand; but
men can never see it come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> It never can be seen with carnal
eyes; it is within.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Lo, I have said, and now I
say again, None but the pure in
heart can see the king, and all the
pure in heart are subjects of the
king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Reform, and turn away from
sin; prepare you, O prepare! the
kingdom is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then he spoke to his disciples
and he said, The seasons of
the son of man are past.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The time will come when you
will wish above all else to see again
one of these days; but you can see
it not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">9</span> And many men will say, Lo,
here is Christ; lo, there is Christ.
Be not deceived; go not into their
ways.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> For when the son of man will
come again no man need point the
way; for as the lightning lights the
heavens, so will the son of man
light up the heavens and earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But, lo, I say, that many
generations will have come and
gone before the son of man shall
come in power; but when he comes
no one will say, Lo, here is Christ;
lo, there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But as it was before the flood
in Noah&#8217;s day, so shall it be. The
people ate, they drank, were filled
with merriment and sung for joy,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And did not know their doom
until the ark was done and Noah
entered in; but then the flood
came on and swept them all away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> So, also, in the days of Lot;
the people ate and drank; they
bought, they sold, they planted
and they reaped, they went their
ways in sin, and they cared not;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But when the righteous Lot
went from their city&#8217;s gates the
earth beneath the city shook, and
brimstone fires fell from heaven;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The gapping jaws of earth
flew wide, and swallowed up their
homes, their wealth, and they went
down to rise no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> So shall it be when comes the
son of man in power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I charge you men, as I will
charge men then, Seek not to save
your wealth, or you will lose your
lives. Go forth, and look not back
upon the crumbling walls of sin.
Do not forget Lot&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Whoever tries to save his
life will lose his life; whoever freely
gives his life in serving life will
save his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Then comes the sifting
time. Two men will be in bed; one
will be called, the other left; two
women will be working side by side;
one will be snatched away, the
other left.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And his disciples said, Explain
to us this parable; or is it not
a parable?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, The wise will
understand, for where the bread of
heaven is, there you will find the
pure in heart; and where the carcass
lies will gather all the birds of prey.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But, lo, I say, before these
days will come, the son of man will
be betrayed by one of you into the
hands of wicked men, and he will
give his life for you and all the
world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Yea, more; the Holy Breath
will come in power and fill you with
the wisdom of the just.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And you will tell the wondrous
story in Judea and in Samaria
and in the farther lands of earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then to teach that men
should pray and never faint, he told
this parable:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> There was a judge who
feared not God, nor yet regarded
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> There was a widow who oft
implored the judge to right her
wrongs and to avenge her foes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> At first the judge would hear
her not, but after many days he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> I fear not God, and I regard
not man, yet, lest this widow wear
me out by pleading every day I
will avenge her on her foes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> When the disciples asked the
meaning of this parable, the Lord
replied, The wise can understand;
the foolish have no need to know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then to teach a lesson
unto certain of his followers who
trusted in themselves and thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
that they were holier than other
men, he told this parable:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Two men went to the synagogue
to pray; one was a Pharisee,
the other was a publican.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The Pharisee stood forth
and prayed thus with himself, O
God, I thank thee that I am not like
other men, who are extortioners,
unjust, adulterers;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Not even like this publican.
I fast two times a week, and I give
tithes of all I get.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> The publican came not a-near;
he would not lift his eyes to
heaven, but smote his breast and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> O Lord, be merciful to me;
I am a sinner in thy sight; I am undone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And now, you men, I say to
you, The publican knew how to
pray, and he was justified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The Pharisee knew how to
talk, but still he went away condemned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Lo, every one who lauds
himself shall be abased, and he who
does not praise himself shall be exalted
in the sight of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And many other loyal souls

that they might celebrate

the harbinger once taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And as they rested by the

and mother of the two disciples,
James and John, came to the master

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> My Lord, I know the kingdom
is about to come, and I would
ask this boon: Command that these
my sons shall sit with you upon the
throne, the one upon the right, the
other on the left.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said to her, You
know not what you ask.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then he turned to James
and John and said, Are you prepared
and are you strong enough
to drink the cup that I will drink?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> They said, Yes, master, we
are strong enough to follow where
you go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Then Jesus said, You shall
indeed drink of my cup; but I am
not the judge of who will sit upon
my right hand or my left.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The men who live the life
and keep the faith will sit upon the
throne of power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Now, when the apostles
heard the pleadings of the mother
for her sons, and knew that James
and John were seeking special favors
from the Lord, they were indignant
and they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> We surely thought that
James and John had risen above
the selfish self. Who can we trust
among the sons of men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus called the ten
apart and said to them, How hard
for men to comprehend the nature
of the kingdom of the soul!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> These two disciples do not
seem to know that rulership in
heaven is not akin to rulership on
earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> In all the kingdoms of the
world, the men of power, they who
exalt themselves, show their authority,
and rule with iron rule;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> But you must know that
they who rule the sons of light are
they who seek no earthly power,
but give their lives in willing sacrifice
for men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Whoever would be great
must be the minister of all. The
highest seat in heaven is at the feet
of him who is the lowest man of
earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> I had a glory with our Father-God
before the worlds were
made, and still I come to serve the
race of men; to be the minister of
men; to give my life for men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And then the Christines
journeyed on and came unto Jerusalem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus speaks to the people in the temple
regarding the messiahship.

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, many Jews from Galilee,
Judea and Samaria were in
Jerusalem and at the feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The porch of Solomon was
filled with scribes and Pharisees
and doctors of the law, and Jesus
walked with them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> A scribe approaching Jesus
said, Rabboni, why do you keep the
people waiting in suspense? If
you are the Messiah that the prophets
said would come, will you not
tell us now?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus said, Lo, I have
told you many times, but you believed
me not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> No man can do the work that
I have done and bring to men the
truth as I have brought the truth
who did not come from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> What I have done and said
are witnesses for me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> God calls, and they whose
ears have been attuned to hear the
heavenly voice have heard the call
and have believed in me; because
God testifies for me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You cannot hear the voice of
God, because your ears are closed.
You cannot comprehend the works
of God, because your hearts are full
of self.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And you are busy-bodies, mischief-makers,
hypocrites. You
take these men whom God has
given me into your haunts and try
to poison them with sophistries and
lies, and think that you will snatch
them from the fold of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> I tell you, men, these men
are tried and you can snatch not
one of them away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> My Father who has given
them to me is greater than you all,
and he and I are one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then the Jews took
stones to throw at him and cried,
Now we have heard enough; away
with him; let him be stoned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> But Joseph, member of the
great Sanhedrim of the Jews, was in
the porch and he came forth and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> You men of Israel, do nothing
rash; throw down those stones;
your reason is a better guide than
passion in such times as these.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> You do not know your accusations
to be true, and if this man
should prove himself to be the
Christ, and you should take his
life, the wrath of God would rest
upon you evermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said to them, Lo,
I have healed your sick, have caused
your blind to see, your deaf to hear,
your lame to walk, and cast out unclean
spirits from your friends;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> For which of these great
works would you desire to take my
life?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The Jews replied, We would
not stone you for your works of
grace, but for your vile, blasphemous
words. You are but man
and still you say that you are God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said, A prophet
of your own said to the sons of men,
Lo, you are gods!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Now, hark, you men, if he
could say that to the men who simply
heard the word of God, why
should you think that I blaspheme
the name of God because I say, I
am a son of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> If you believe not what I say
you must have faith in what I do,
and you should see the Father in
these works, and know that I dwell
in the Father-God, and that the Father
dwells in me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And then again the Jews
took stones and would have stoned
him in the temple court; but he
withdrew himself from sight and
left the porch and court and went
his way;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And with the twelve he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
to Jericho, and after certain days
they crossed the Jordan and in
Bethabara abode for many days.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Lazarus dies and Jesus and the
twelve return to Bethany. The resurrection
of Lazarus, which greatly
excites the rulers in Jerusalem.
The Christines go to the hills of
Ephriam, and there abide.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">One</span> day as Jesus and the twelve
were in the silence in a home
in Araba a messenger came and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Lord, Jesus, hear! your friend
in Bethany is sick, nigh unto death;
his sisters urge that you arise and
come in haste.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Then turning to the twelve the
master said, Lo, Lazarus has gone
to sleep, and I must go and waken
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And his disciples said, What
need to go if he has gone to sleep;
he will awaken by and by?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Then Jesus said, It is the
sleep of death; for Lazarus is dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> But Jesus did not haste to go;
he stayed two days in Araba; and
then he said, The hour has come and
we must go to Bethany.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> But his disciples urged him
not to go; they said, The Jews are
waiting your return that they may
take your life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, Men cannot
take my life till I have handed unto
them my life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when the time shall come
I will myself lay down my life; that
time is near, and God knows best;
I must arise and go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Thomas said, Then we
will also go; yes, we will offer up our
lives and die with him. And they
arose and went.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth
and many friends were weeping in
their home when one approached
and said, The Lord has come; but
Mary did not hear the words.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But Ruth and Martha heard,
and they arose and went to meet the
Lord; he waited at the village gate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And when they met the master
Martha said, You are too late,
for Lazarus is dead; if you had only
been with us I know that he would
not have died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But even now I know that
you have power over death; that
by the sacred Word you may cause
life to rise from death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, Behold, for
Lazarus shall live again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Martha said, I know
that he will rise and live again when
all the dead shall rise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, I am the
resurrection and the life; he who
has faith in me, though he be dead,
yet shall he live;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And he who is alive, and has
a living faith in me, shall never die.
Do you believe what I have said?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Martha said, Lord, I
believe that you are come to manifest
the Christ of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Then Jesus said, Go back
and call aside your sister, and my
mother and the prophetess and say
that I have come; and I will stay
here by the gate till they have come
to me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Ruth and Martha did
as Jesus bade them do, and in a
little while the Marys and the prophetess
had met the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Mary said, Why did
you tarry thus? If you had been
with us our brother, dear, would
not have died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Then Jesus went up to the
house and when he saw the heavy
grief of all, he was himself stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
up with grief, and said, Where is
the tomb in which he lies?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> They said, Lord, come and
see. And Jesus wept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The people said, Behold how
Jesus loved this man!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And others said, Could not
this Lord who opened up the eyes
of one born blind, have saved this
man from death?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But soon the mourners stood
beside the tomb, a sepulcher hewn
out of solid rock; a massive stone
closed up the door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Jesus said, Take you
away the stone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But Martha said, Lord, is it
well? Behold our brother has been
dead four days; the body must be
in decay, and is it well that we
should see it now?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The Lord replied, Have you
forgotten, Martha, what I said
while we were at the village gate?
Did I not say that you should see
the glory of the Lord?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And then they rolled the
stone away; the flesh had not decayed;
and Jesus lifted up his eyes
to heaven and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> My Father-God, thou who
hast ever heard my prayers, I thank
thee now, and that these multitudes
may know that thou hast sent me
forth, that I am thine and thou art
mine, make strong the Word of
power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And then he spoke the Word,
and in a voice that souls can comprehend,
he said, O Lazarus, awake!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And Lazarus arose and came
out of the tomb. The grave clothes
were about him fast, and Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Loose him and let him go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> The people were amazed
and multitudes confessed their faith
in him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And some went to Jerusalem
and told the Pharisees about this
resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The chief priests were confounded,
and they said, What shall
we do? This man is doing many
mighty deeds, and if we do not stay
him in his work, all men will look
on him as king, and through the
Romans he may take the throne,
and we will lose our place and power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And then the chief priests
and the Pharisees in council met
and sought a plan by which they
might put him to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Caiaphas was the high priest
then, and he came forth and said,
You men of Israel, do you not know
the law?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Do you not know that in
such times as these we may give up
one life to save our nation and our
laws?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Caiaphas did not know that
he was prophet, speaking out the
words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> He did not know the time
had come for Jesus to be offered up
a sacrifice for every man, for Jew
and Greek, and all the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> From that day forth the
Jews conferred together every day,
maturing plans to put the Lord to
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> Now, Jesus and the twelve
did not remain in Bethany; but in
the hills of Ephriam, upon the borders
of Samaria, they found a home,
and there abode for many days.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_149">CHAPTER 149.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Jews gather in Jerusalem to attend
the feast. The Christines go
to Jericho. Jesus dines with Zaccheus.
He relates the parable of the
ten talents.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> great passover of the Jews,
the feast of spring, was calling
every loyal Jew up to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">2</span> Ten days before the feast the
Lord and his disciples left the Ephriam
hills and, by the Jordan way,
went down to Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And as they entered Jericho
a wealthy publican came out to see
the Lord; but he was small in stature
and the throng was great and he
could see him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> A tree, a sycamore, stood by
the way and he climbed up the tree
and found a seat among its boughs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> When Jesus came, he saw the
man and said, O Zaccheus, make
haste, come down; I would abide
with you today.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Zaccheus came down and
joyfully received the Lord; but
many of the stricter sect called out
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> For shame! he goes to lodge
with Zaccheus, the sinner and the
publican.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> But Jesus did not care for
what they said; he went his way
with Zaccheus, who was a man of
faith, and as they talked together
Zaccheus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Lord, I have ever tried to do
the right; I give unto the poor half
of my goods, and if by any means I
wrong a man, I right the wrong by
paying him four fold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said to him, Your
life and faith are known to God,
and lo, the benedictions of the Lord
of hosts abide with you and all your
house.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Then Jesus spoke a parable
to all; he said, A vassal of an emperor
was made a king, and he went
to the foreign land to claim his rights
and take the kingdom to himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Before he went he called ten
trusted servants and to each he gave
a pound and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Go forth and use these
pounds as you have opportunity,
that you may gain for me more
wealth. And then he went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And after many days he
came again, and called the ten, demanding
a report.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The first one came and said,
Lord, I have gained for you nine
pounds; you gave me one and here
are ten.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The king replied, Well done,
you faithful man; because you have
been faithful in a little thing I
judge that you will be a faithful
servant in a greater thing;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Behold, I make you ruler
over nine important cities of my
realm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> The second came and said,
Lord, I have gained for you four
pounds; you gave me one, and here
are five.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The king replied, and you
have proven up your faithfulness.
Behold, I make you ruler over four
important cities of my realm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Another came and said, Lord,
I have doubled what you gave to me.
You gave one pound to me and here
are two.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The ruler said, And you have
proved your faithfulness; Behold,
I make you ruler over one important
city of my realm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Another came and said, Lord,
here is what you gave to me. I
knew you were an austere man, oft
reaping where you did not sow and
I was sore afraid, and so I took the
pound you gave to me and hid it in
a secret place; and here it is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The king exclaimed, You
slothful man! you knew what I required,
that I expected every man
to do his best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> If you were timid and afraid
to trust your judgment in the marts
of trade, why did you not go forth
and put my money out for gain, that
I could have my own with interest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">25</span> Then turning to the steward
of his wealth the ruler said, Take
you this pound and give it unto him
who has by diligence earned nine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> For lo, I say, that every one
who uses what he has and gains,
shall have abundantly; but he who
hides away his talent in the earth
shall forfeit what he has.</p>

heart he said, Praise God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus rebukes a barren fig tree.
Drives the merchants out of the
temple. Teaches the people. Returns
to Bethany.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, the Monday of the
week, the master with the
twelve, went to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And as they passed along the
way they saw a fig tree full of leaves
without a sign of fruit.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus spoke unto the
tree; he said, You useless cumberer
of the ground; you fig tree fair to
look upon, but a delusive thing.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> You take from earth and air
the food that fruitful trees should
have.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Go back to earth and be yourself
the food for other trees to eat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> When Jesus had thus spoken
to the tree he went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And when he reached the temple,
lo, the rooms were filled with
petty merchants selling doves and
animals, and other things, for sacrifice;
the temple was a mart of
trade.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus was indignant at
the sight, and said, You men of
Israel, for shame! This is supposed
to be the house of prayer; but it is
now a den of thieves. Remove this
plunder from this holy place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The merchants only laughed
and said, We are protected in our
trade by those who bear the rule;
we will not go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Then Jesus made a scourge
of cords, as he did once before, and
rushed among the merchantmen,
threw all their money on the floor;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Threw wide the cages of the
doves, and cut the cords that held
the bleating lambs and set them
free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then he drove the merchants
from the place, and with a
clean, new broom he swept the
floors.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Chief priests and scribes were
filled with wrath, but feared to
touch or even to rebuke the Lord,
for all the people stood in his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus taught the people
all day long and healed a multitude
of those diseased,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And when the evening came
he went again to Bethany.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_153">CHAPTER 153.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines go to Jerusalem.
They note the withered fig tree; its
symbolic meaning. Jesus teaches
in the temple. Is censured by the
priests. Relates a parable of a
rich man&#8217;s feast.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday, early in the day,
the master and the twelve
went to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And as they went the twelve
observed the tree to which the Lord
had talked the day before, and lo,
the leaves were withered, just as if
they had been scorched with fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Peter said, Lord, see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
tree! Its leaves are withered and
the tree seems dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus said, So shall it
be with those who bear no fruit.
When God shall call them up to
give account, lo, he will breathe
upon them, and their leaves, their
empty words, will wither and decay.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> God will not let the fruitless
trees of life encumber ground, and
he will pluck them up and cast them
all away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Now, you can demonstrate
the power of God. Have faith in
God, and you can bid the mountains
to depart, and they will crumble
at your feet;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And you may talk to wind and
wave, and they will hear, and will
obey what you command.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> God hears the prayer of faith
and when you ask in faith you shall
receive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> You must not ask amiss; God
will not hear the prayer of any man
who comes to him with blood of
other men upon his hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And he who harbors envious
thoughts, and does not love his fellow
men, may pray forever unto
God, and he will hear him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> God can do nothing more for
men than they would do for other
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus walked again within
the temple courts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The priests and scribes were
much emboldened by the council of
Caiaphas and the other men in
power, and so they came to Jesus
and they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Who gave you the authority
to do as you have done? Why did
you drive the merchants from the
temple yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus answered them
and said, If you will answer what I
ask, then I will answer you; Was
John, the harbinger, a man of God,
or was he a seditious man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The scribes and Pharisees
were loath to answer him; they reasoned
thus among themselves:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> If we shall say, John was a
prophet sent from God, then he will
say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> John testified for me, that I
am son of God; why do you not believe
his words?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> If we should say, John was a
bold, seditious man, the people will
be angered, for they think he was
a prophet of the living God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And so they answered Jesus
and they said, We do not know; we
cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then Jesus said, If you will
tell me not, then I will tell you not
who gave me power to drive the robbers
from the house of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And then he spoke a parable
to them; he said, A man once made
a feast inviting all the rich and honored
people of the land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> But when they came, they
found the door into the banquet
hall was low, and they could enter
not except they bowed their heads
and fell down on their knees.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> These people would not bow
their heads and fall down on their
knees, and so they went away; they
went not to the feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And then the man sent forth
his messengers to bid the common
folks, and those of low estate, to
come and feast with him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> These people gladly came;
they bowed their heads and fell
down on their knees, and came into
the banquet hall and it was full,
and every one rejoiced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then the master said,
Behold, you priests and scribes, and
Pharisees! the Lord of heaven and
earth has spread a sumptuous feast,
and you were bidden first of all;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">28</span> But you have found the door
into the banquet hall so low that
you must bow your heads and fall
down on your knees to enter in,
and you have scorned the king who
made the feast, refused to bow your
heads and fall down on your knees,
and you have gone your way;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But now God calls again;
the common folks and those of low
estate have come in multitudes,
have entered in unto the feast and
all rejoice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> I tell you, men, that publicans
and courtesans go through the
gates into the kingdom of the God
of heaven, and you are left without.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> John came to you in righteousness;
he brought the truth, but
you believed him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> But publicans and courtesans
believed, and were baptized
and now have entered in unto the
feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> I tell you now, as I have told
you many times, The many have
been called, but chosen are the few.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_154">CHAPTER 154.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus teaches in the temple court.
The parable of the householder and
wicked husbandmen. Parable of
the marriage feast and the guest
without a wedding robe.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> multitudes would hear what
Jesus had to say, and so they
built a platform in the temple court,
and Jesus stood upon the place and
taught. He spoke in parables; he
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A man possessed a vast estate;
he planted out a vineyard, placed a
hedge about it, built a tower, installed
the press for making wine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> He placed his vineyard in the
hands of husbandmen and then he
journeyed to a distant land.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Now, in the vintage time the
man sent forth a servant to receive
and bring to him his portion of the
fruitage of the vines.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The husbandmen came forth
and beat the man; laid forty lashes
on his back and cast him out beyond
the vineyard gate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And then the owner sent another
man to bring to him his own.
The husbandmen laid hold of him
and sorely wounded him and cast
him from the vineyard, leaving him
half dead beside the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The owner sent another man
to bring to him his own. The husbandmen
seized hold of him and
with a javelin they pierced his heart;
then buried him beyond the hedge.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The owner was aggrieved.
He thought within himself, What
shall I do? and then he said, This
will I do. My only son is here, and
I will send him to the husbandmen,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> They surely will respect my
son and send me what is mine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He sent his son; the husbandmen
took counsel with themselves;
they said, This is the only heir to all
this wealth, and if we take his life
the vast inheritance is ours.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> They took his life and cast
him out beyond the vineyard hedge.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The days will come; the
owner will return to reckon with the
husbandmen, and he will seize them
every one, and cast them into
scorching fires where they shall stay
until they pay the debts they owe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And he will place his vineyard
in the care of honest men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Then turning to the priests
and scribes he said, Did not your
prophets say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The stone the builders cast
away became the capstone of the
arch?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> You men who pose as men of
God, as husbandmen, lo, you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
stoned and killed the messengers of
God, his prophets and his seers, and
now you seek to slay his son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> I tell you men, the kingdom
shall be snatched away from you,
and shall be given unto people who
are not a people now, and to a nation
that is not a nation now.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And men whose speech you
cannot understand, will stand between
the living and the dead, and
show the way to life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The chief priests and the
Pharisees were deeply moved with
anger when they heard this parable,
and would have seized the Lord and
done him harm, but they were sore
afraid; they feared the multitude.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus spoke another parable;
he said, The kingdom is alike
a certain king who made a feast in
honor of the marriage of his son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> He sent his servants forth
to call the people who had been invited
to the feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The servants called; but then
the people would not come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then the king sent other
messengers abroad to say, Behold,
my tables now are spread; my oxen
and my fatlings are prepared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The choicest viands and the
richest wines are on my boards;
come to the marriage feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The people laughed and
treated with disdain his call, and
went their way, one to his farm, another
to his merchandise;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And others seized the servants
of the king; abused them
shamefully; and some of them they
killed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then the king sent forth
his soldiery who slew the murderers
and burned their towns.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And then the king sent other
servants forth; to them he said, Go
to the corners of the streets, the
partings of the ways, and to the
marts of trade and say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Whoever will may come up
to the marriage feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The servants went their way
and called; and lo, the banquet hall
was filled with guests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> But when the king came in
to see the guests, he saw a man who
had not on a wedding robe; he called
to him and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Friend, why are you here
without a wedding robe? Would
you dishonor thus my son?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The man was dumb; he answered
not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And then the king said to his
guards, Take you this man and bind
him hand and foot and cast him
out into the darkness of the night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> The many have been called,
but none are chosen to be guests
who have not clad themselves in
wedding robes.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_155">CHAPTER 155.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus recognizes the justice of paying
secular taxes. He teaches a lesson
on family relationships in the life
beyond. The greatest of the commandments
is comprised in love.
He warns his disciples against the
hypocrisy of scribes and Pharisees.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">As</span> Jesus spoke, the Pharisees
came up to question him; they
thought to criminate him by what
he said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A strict Herodian spoke and
said, My Lord, you are a man of
truth; you show the way to God,
and you do not regard the personality
of men;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Tell us, what do you think;
should we, who are the seed of
Abraham, pay tribute unto Cæsar?
or should we not?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus knew his wickedness
of heart and said, Why do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
come to tempt me thus? Show me
the tribute money that you speak
about.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The man brought forth a
piece of coin on which an image was
engraved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus said, Whose image
and whose name is on this coin?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The man replied, &#8217;Tis Cæsar&#8217;s
image and his name.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Jesus said, Give unto
Cæsar that which is Cæsar&#8217;s own;
but give to God the things of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And they who heard him said,
He answers well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then a Sadducee, who
thinks there is no resurrection of
the dead, came up and said, Rabboni,
Moses wrote that if a married
man shall die, and have no child,
his widow shall become his brother&#8217;s
wife.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Now, there were seven brothers
and the eldest had a wife; he
died and had no child; a brother
took his widow for his wife, and
then he died;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And every brother had this
woman for his wife; in course of time
the woman died;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Now which will have this
woman for a wife in the resurrection
day?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, Here in this
plane of life men marry just to gratify
their selfish selfs, or to perpetuate
the race; but in the world to
come, and in the resurrection day,
men do not take upon themselves
the marriage vows,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But, like the angels and the
other sons of God, they form not
unions for the pleasure of the self,
nor to perpetuate the race.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Death does not mean the
end of life. The grave is not the
goal of men, no more than is the
earth the goal of seeds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Life is the consequence of
death. The seed may seem to die,
but from its grave the tree arises
into life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> So man may seem to die,
but he lives on, and from the grave
he springs up into life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> If you could comprehend the
word that Moses spoke about the
burning bush that burned and still
was not consumed, then you would
know that death cannot destroy the
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Moses said that God is
God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Israel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> God is not God of dead men&#8217;s
bones, but of the living man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> I tell you, men, man goes
down to the grave, but he will rise
again and manifest the life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> For every life is hid with
Christ in God, and man shall live
while God shall live.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The Pharisees and scribes
who heard the Lord, exclaimed, He
speaks the truth; and they were glad
to have the Sadducees discomfited.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And then an honest scribe
came forth and said to Jesus, Lord,
you speak as one whom God has
sent, and may I ask,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Which is the greatest and
the first of the Commandments of
the Law?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, The first is:
Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is
one; and you shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart, with
all your mind, with all your soul,
with all your strength;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And you shall love your
neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> These are the greatest of the
ten, and on them hang the Law,
the Prophets and the Psalms.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The scribe replied, My soul
gives witness that you speak the
truth, for love fulfills the law, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
far transcends burnt offerings and
sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Jesus said to him, Lo,
you have solved a mystery; you are
within the kingdom and the kingdom
is in you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> To his disciples Jesus spoke,
and all the people heard; he said,
Beware you of the scribes and Pharisees
who pride themselves in wearing
long and richly decorated robes,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And love to be saluted in the
market place, and seek the highest
seats at feasts, and take the hard-earned
wages of the poor to satisfy
their carnal selves, and pray in public,
long and loud.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> These are the wolves who
clothe themselves to look like
sheep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And then he said to all, The
scribes and Pharisees are placed by
law in Moses&#8217; seat, and by the law
they may interpret law;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> So what they bid you do,
that do; but do not imitate their
deeds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> They say the things that
Moses taught; they do the things of
Beelzebul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> They talk of mercy, yet they
bind on human shoulders burdens
grievous to bear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> They talk of helpfulness, and
yet they put not forth the slightest
helpful efforts for their brother
man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> They make a show of doing
things, and yet they do not anything
but show their gaudy robes,
and broad phylacteries, and smile
when people call them honored masters
of the law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> They strut about and show
their pride when people call them
father, so and so.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Hear, now, you men, Call no
man father here. The God of
heaven and earth, and he alone, is
Father of the race of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> Christ is the hierarch, the
high, exalted master of the sons of
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> If you would be exalted, sit
down at the master&#8217;s feet and serve.
He is the greatest man who serves
the best.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The rich men came and gave
of their abundance; and then he saw
a poor but loyal widow come and
put a farthing in the treasure box.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then he said to his disciples
who were standing by, Behold,
for this poor widow who has put a
farthing in the treasury has done
more than they all;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> For she has given all she had;
the rich have given just a little
share of what they have.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> A company of Grecian Jews
were at the feast, and they met
Philip, who could talk with them,
and said, Sir, we would see the Lord,
this Jesus, who is called the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Philip led the way, and
brought them to the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And Jesus said, The hour has
come; the son of man is ready to be
glorified, and it cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Except a grain of wheat fall
into earth and die it can be nothing
but a grain of wheat; but if it
die it lives again, and from its grave
a hundred grains of wheat arise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> My soul is troubled now;
What shall I say? And then he
cast his eyes to heaven and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> My Father-God, I would not
ask to be relieved of all the burdens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
I must bear; I only ask for grace
and strength to bear the burdens
whatso&#8217;er they be,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> This is the hour for which I
came to earth. O Father, glorify
thy name!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And then the place was
lighted with a light more brilliant
than the noonday sun; the people
stood a-back; they were afraid.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And then a voice that seemed
to come from heaven said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> I have both glorified my
name and yours, and I will honor
them again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The people heard the voice,
and some exclaimed, Behold, a distant
thunder! Others said, An angel
spoke to him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> But Jesus said, This voice
was not for me; it was for you, that
you might know that I am come
from God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Now is the judgment of the
world at hand; the prince of darkness
shall be manifest and go unto
his own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> The son of man will now be
lifted up from earth, and he will
draw all men unto himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> The people said, The law declares
that Christ abides forever
more. How can you say, The son
of man will now be lifted up? Who
is the son of man?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> And Jesus said to them, The
light is shining now; walk in the
light while you still have the light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> The darkness comes; but he
who walks in darkness cannot find
the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> Again I say, Walk in the
light while you still have the light,
that men may know that you are
sons of light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> And Jesus stood out in the
temple porch, and made his last appeal
unto the multitudes; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> He who believes in me, believes
in God who sent me forth to
do his will, and he who sees me now
beholds my Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> Behold, I came a light unto
the world; he who believes in me
shall walk in light, the light of life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> You men who hear me now,
If you believe me not, I judge you
not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> I am not come to judge the
world, but I am come to save the
world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">51</span> God is the only judge of men;
but what I speak will stand against
you in the day when God will judge
the world;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">52</span> For from myself I do not
speak; I speak the words that God
has given me to speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">53</span> And then he said, Jerusalem,
with all your glory and your
crimes, Farewell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines upon Mount Olives.
Jesus prophecies the destruction of
Jerusalem, and of terrible disasters
that will mark the conclusion of the
age. He exhorts his disciples to
faithfulness.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Then</span> Jesus with the twelve
went forth and sat upon Mount
Olives, just beyond the city&#8217;s gate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And his disciples said, Behold
the wondrous city of Jerusalem!
its homes are all so beautiful! its
temples and its shrines are clothed
in such magnificence!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus said, The city is the
glory of my people, Israel, but, lo,
the time will come when every
stone will be cast down, and it will
be a hiss and byword for the nations
of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And the disciples asked, When
will this desolation come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, This round of
human life will not be full until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
armies of the conqueror will thunder
at her gates, and they will enter
in, and blood will flow like
water through the streets.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And all the precious furnishings
of temple, court and palaces
will be destroyed, or carried off to
deck the palaces and courts of
kings.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Behold, these days are not at
hand. Before they come, lo, you
shall be maltreated by the scribes
and Pharisees, the high priests and
the doctors of the law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Without a cause you will be
haled into the courts; you will be
stoned; you will be beaten in the
synagogues; will stand condemned
before the rulers of this world, and
governors and kings will sentence
you to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> But you will falter not, and
you will testify for truth and righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And in these hours be anxious
not about your speech; you
need not think of what to say;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> For, lo, the Holy Breath will
overshadow you and give you
words to say.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> But then the carnage will go
on, and men will think that they are
pleasing God by killing you, and nations
far and near will hate you for
the sake of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And men will stir up evil
thoughts among your kin, and they
will hate you and will give you up to
die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And brothers will be false to
brothers; fathers will stand forth
and testify against their own, and
children will drive parents to the
funeral pile.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> When you shall hear the Roman
eagle screaming in the air, and
see his legions streaming o&#8217;er the
plain, then know the desolation of
Jerusalem is near.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then let the wise wait not,
but flee. Let him who is upon his
house wait not to enter in the house
to gather up his wealth, but let him
flee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And he who labors in the
field must not return, but leave his
all to save his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And woe to mothers with
their little children in that day;
none shall escape the sword.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The tribulation of these days
cannot be told in words, for such
has never been since God created
man upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The conqueror will carry
many of the sons of Abraham away
as captives into foreign lands, and
they who know not Israel&#8217;s God
will tread the highways of Jerusalem
until the anti-Jewish times have
been fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> But when the people have
been punished for their crimes, the
tribulation days will end; but lo,
the time will come when all the
world will rise, like gladiators in a
ring, and fight just for the sake of
shedding blood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And men will reason not;
they will not see, nor care to see a
cause for carnage, desolation, thefts;
for they will war with friend or foe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The very air will seem surcharged
with smoke of death; and
pestilence will follow close upon the
sword.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And signs that men have
never seen will then appear in
heaven and earth; in sun, and moon,
and stars.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The seas will roar, and
sounds will come from heaven that
men can never comprehend, and
these will bring distress of nations
with perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Hearts of the strongest men
will faint in fear, in expectation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the coming of more frightful things
upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But while the conflicts rage
on land and sea, the Prince of Peace
will stand above the clouds of
heaven and say again:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Peace, peace on earth; good
will to men; and every man will
throw away his sword, and nations
will learn war no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then the man who bears
the pitcher will walk forth across an
arc of heaven; the sign and signet
of the son of man will stand forth in
the eastern sky.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The wise will then lift up
their heads and know that the redemption
of the earth is near.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Before these days shall come,
behold, false Christs and poor deluded
prophets will arise in many
lands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And they will show forth
signs, and do a multitude of mighty
works; and they will lead astray the
many who are not wise; and many
of the wise will be deceived.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And now I tell you once
again, When men shall say, The
Christ is in the wilderness, go you
not forth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And if they say, The Christ
is in the secret place, believe it not;
for when he comes the world will
know that he has come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> For as the morning light
comes from the east and shines unto
the west; so shall be the coming of
the age and son of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> The wicked of the earth will
weep when they shall see the son of
man come down upon the clouds of
heaven, in power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Take heed you, O take heed,
for you know not the hour nor the
day when comes the son of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Let not your hearts be overcharged
with sensuous things, nor
with the cares of life, lest that day
come and find you unprepared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> Keep watch at every season
of the year; and pray that you may
meet the Lord with joy and not with
grief.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> Before these days shall come
our Father-God will send his messengers
abroad, yea, to the corners
of the earth, and they will say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Prepare you, O prepare; the
Prince of Peace shall come, and now
is coming on the clouds of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> When Jesus had thus said,
he went with his disciples back to
Bethany.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_158">CHAPTER 158.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and the twelve at prayer in Olivet.
Jesus reveals to his disciples
the deeper meanings of secret doctrines.
He tells them what to teach
the people. Relates a number of
parables. They return to Bethany.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the Wednesday
of the week was come, and
Jesus with the twelve went out to
Olivet to pray; and they were lost
in prayer for seven hours.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Then Jesus called the twelve
close to his side and said, This day
the curtain parts and we will step
beyond the veil into the secret
courts of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And Jesus opened up to them
the meaning of the hidden way, and
of the Holy Breath, and of the
light that cannot fail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He told them all about the
Book of Life, the Rolls of Graphael,
the Book of God&#8217;s Remembrance
where all the thoughts and words
of men are written down.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> He did not speak aloud to
them; he told the secrets of the masters
in an undertone, and when he
spoke the name of God there was
a silence in the courts of heaven for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
half an hour, for angels spoke with
bated breath.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Jesus said, These things
may not be spoken out aloud; they
never may be written down; they
are the messages of Silenceland;
they are the Breathings of the inner
heart of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And then the master taught
the twelve the lessons they should
teach to other men. He sometimes
taught in parables; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You call to mind the words of
yesterday about the coming of the
son of man. Now, you shall teach
to other men what I have spoken
and am speaking unto you;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Teach them to pray and not
to faint; to be prepared at every
moment of the day, for when they
least expect him, then the Lord will
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> A man went to a distant land
and left his house and all his wealth
in care of servants; five to guard his
house and five to guard his barns
and herds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The servants waited long for
his return, but he came not, and
they grew careless in their work;
some spent their time in revelings
and drunkenness, and some slept
at their posts.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And night by night the robbers
came and carried off the wealth
from house and barn, and drove
away the choicest of the herds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And when they knew that
much of all the wealth that they
were left to guard had been purloined,
they said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> We cannot be to blame; if
we had known the day and hour
when our lord would come again
we would have guarded well his
wealth, and suffered not the thieves
to carry it away; he surely is at
fault because he told us not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> But after many days the
lord returned, and when he knew
that thieves had robbed him of his
wealth, he called his servants and
he said to them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Because you have neglected
what was given you to do, have
spent your time in revelings and
sleep, behold you all are debtors
unto me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> What I have lost by your
neglect, you owe to me. And then
he gave them heavy tasks to do,
and bound them to their posts with
chains, where they remained till
they had paid for all the goods
their lord had lost through their
neglect.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Another man locked up his
wealth and went to sleep, and in the
night time robbers came, unlocked
his doors, and when they saw no
guard, they entered in and carried
off his wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And when the man awoke
and found his doors ajar and all his
treasures gone, he said, If I had
known the hour when the thieves
would come I would have been on
guard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Beware, my friends, beware!
and be prepared at every hour, and
if your Lord shall come at midnight
or at dawn, it matters not, for he
will find you ready to receive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then, behold, a marriage
was announced, and virgins, ten of
them, were set apart to meet the
bridegroom when he came.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The virgins clothed themselves
in proper garbs, and took
their lamps and sat in waiting for
the watch to say, Behold, the bridegroom
comes!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Now, five were wise; they
filled their lamps with oil; and five
were foolish, for they carried empty
lamps.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The groom came not at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
expected time; the virgins were
a-weary with their watch and slept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> At midnight came the cry,
Behold, the bridegroom comes!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The virgins rose; the wise
ones quickly trimmed their lamps
and went forth ready to receive the
groom.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The foolish virgins said, We
have no oil, our lamps burn not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> They sought to borrow from
the wise, who said, We have no oil
to spare; Go to the merchantmen
and buy and fill your lamps and
then come forth to meet the groom.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> But while they went to purchase
oil, the bridegroom came; the
virgins who were ready with their
lamps all trimmed went with him
to the marriage feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And when the foolish virgins
came the door was shut, and though
they knocked and called aloud, the
door was opened not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The master of the feast exclaimed,
I know you not! and in disgrace
the virgins went their way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Again I say to you, and you
shall say to them who follow you,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Be ready every moment of
the day and night, because when
you expect him not, the Lord will
come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> Behold, when he will come
with all his messengers of light, the
Book of Life, and that of Records,
shall be opened up&mdash;the books in
which the thoughts and words and
deeds are written down.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And every one can read the
records he has written for himself,
and he will know his doom before
the judge shall speak, and this will
be the sifting time.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> According to their records
men will find their own.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> The judge is Righteousness,
the king of all the earth, and he will
separate the multitudes as shepherds
separate the sheep and goats.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The sheep will find their
places on the right, the goats upon
the left, and every man will know
his place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And then the judge will say,
to those upon the right, You blessed
of the Father-God, come unto your
inheritance, which was prepared
for you from times of old.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> You have been servants of
the race; and I was hungry and you
gave me bread; was thirsty and you
gave me drink; was naked and you
gave me clothes;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Was sick, you ministered to
me; and was in prison and you came
to me with words of cheer; I was a
stranger and in your homes I found
a home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Then will the righteous say,
When did we see you hungry,
thirsty, sick, imprisoned or a stranger
at our gates and ministered to
you?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> And then the judge will say,
You served the sons of men, and
whatsoever you have done for these,
that you have done for me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> The judge will say to those
upon the left, Depart from me; you
have not served the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> I was hungry and you gave
me naught to eat; was thirsty and
you gave me naught to drink; I
was a stranger and you drove me
from your door; I was imprisoned
and was sick, you did not minister
to me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> Then these will say, When
did we thus neglect to care for you?
When did we see you hungry,
thirsty, sick, a stranger or in prison
and did not minister to you?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> And then the judge will say,
Your life was full of self; you served
the self and not your fellow man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and when you slighted one of these,
you slighted and neglected me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> Then will the righteous have
the kingdom and the power, and
they who are unrighteous shall go
forth to pay their debts, to suffer
all that men have suffered at their
hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> They who have ears to hear
and hearts to understand will comprehend
these parables.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> When he had finished all
these parables he said, You know
that in two days the great passover
feast will come, and lo, the son of
man will be betrayed into the hands
of wicked men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">51</span> And he will give his life upon
the cross, and men will know that
he, the son of man, is son of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">52</span> Then Jesus and the twelve
returned to Bethany.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_159">CHAPTER 159.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The Christines attend a feast in Simon&#8217;s
house. Mary anoints the
master with a costly balm, and Judas
and others rebuked her for profligacy.
Jesus defends her. The
rulers of the Jews employ Ananias
to arrest Jesus. Ananias bribes
Judas to aid him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap">Bar-Simon,</span> who was once a
leper and was cleansed by
Jesus by the sacred Word, abode in
Bethany.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> In honor of the Christine
Lord he gave a feast, and Lazarus
was among the guests, and Ruth
and Martha served.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And as the guests reclined
about the table, Mary took a cruse
of rich perfume and poured it out
on Jesus&#8217; head and feet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And then she knelt and with
her hair she wiped his feet; the odor
of the rich perfume filled all the
room.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Now, Judas, always looking
at the selfish side of life, exclaimed,
For shame! why did you waste that
costly perfume thus?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> We might have sold it for
three hundred pence, and had the
money to supply our wants and feed
the poor.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> (Now, Judas was the treasurer,
and carried all the money of
the Christine band.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And others said, Why, Mary,
what a profligate you are! you
should not throw such wealth away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> But Jesus said, You men, be
still; let her alone; you know not
what you say.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The poor are with you constantly;
at any time you can administer
to them; but I will not be
with you long.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Mary knows the sadness
of the coming days; she has anointed
me beforehand for my burial.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The gospel of the Christ will
everywhere be preached, and he
who tells the story of the Christ will
tell about this day; and what was
done by Mary at this hour will be a
sweet memorial to her wherever
men abide.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And when the feast was over
Jesus went with Lazarus to his
home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Now, in Jerusalem the priests
and Pharisees were busy with their
plans to seize the Lord and take his
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">15</span> The high priest called in
counsel all the wisest men and said,
This deed must be accomplished in
a secret way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> He must be taken when the
multitudes are not a-near, else we
may cause a war; the common people
may stand forth in his defense
and thus pollute this sacred place
with human blood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And what we do, that we
must do before the great day of the
feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Ananias said, I have a
plan that will succeed. The twelve
with Jesus every day go forth alone
to pray;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And we will find their trysting
place; then we can seize the man
and bring him here without the
knowledge of the multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> I know one of the twelve, a
man who worships wealth, and for a
sum I think that he will lead the
way to where the man is wont to
pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And then Caiaphas said, If
you will lead the way and bribe the
man of whom you speak, to aid in
seizing Jesus in a secret place, then
we will give to you a hundred silver
pieces for your hire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Ananias said, &#8217;Tis well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And then he went to Bethany
and found the twelve at Simon&#8217;s
house, and calling Judas to the side
he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> If you would care to make a
sum of money for yourself hear me:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The high priest and the other
rulers in Jerusalem would like to
talk with Jesus when alone, that
they may know about his claims;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And if he proves himself to
be the Christ, lo, they will stand in
his defense.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Now, if you will but lead the
way to where your master is tomorrow
night that they may send
a priest to talk with him alone,
there is a sum of silver, thirty pieces,
that the priests will give to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Judas reasoned with
himself; he said, It surely may be
well to give the Lord a chance to
tell the priests about his claims
when he is all alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And if the priests would do
him harm he has the power to disappear
and go his way as he has
done before; and thirty pieces is a
goodly sum.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And so he said to Ananias, I
will lead the way, and by a kiss
make known which person is the
Lord.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus and the twelve eat the passover

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">On</span> Thursday morning Jesus
called to him the twelve disciples,
and he said to them, This is
God&#8217;s remembrance day, and we
will eat the pascal supper all alone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And then he said to Peter,
James and John, Go now into Jerusalem
and there prepare the pasch.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And the disciples said, Where
would you have us go to find the
place where we may have the feast
prepared?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Jesus said, Go by the
fountain gate and you will see a
man who has a pitcher in his hand.
Speak unto him and say: This is the
first day of unleavened bread;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The Lord would have you set
apart your banquet hall where he
may eat his last passover with the
twelve.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Fear not to speak; the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
whom you will see is Nicodemus, a
ruler of the Jews, and yet a man of
God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And the disciples went and
found the man as Jesus said, and
Nicodemus hastened to his home;
the banquet hall, an upper room,
was set apart, the supper was prepared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, in the afternoon the
Lord and his disciples went up to
Jerusalem and found the feast in
readiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And when the hour had come
to eat the feast, the twelve began
to strive among themselves, each
anxious to secure the honored seats.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus said, My friends,
would you contend for self just as
the shadows of this night of gloom
comes on?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> There is no honored seat at
heaven&#8217;s feast except for him who
humbly takes the lowest seat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then the Lord arose and
took a basin full of water and a
towel, and bowing down, he washed
the feet of all the twelve and dried
them with the towel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> He breathed upon them and
he said, And may these feet walk in
the ways of righteousness forevermore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> He came to Peter and was
about to wash his feet, and Peter
said, Lord, would you wash my
feet?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, You do not
comprehend the meaning of the
thing I do, but you will comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Peter said, My master,
no, you shall not stoop to wash my
feet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Jesus said, My friend,
if I wash not your feet you have no
part with me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Peter said, Then, O
my Lord, wash both my feet, my
hands, my head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said to him, He
who has taken first his bath is
clean, and has no need to wash, except
his feet.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The feet are truly symbols
of the understanding of the man,
and he who would be clean must, in
the living stream of life, wash well
his understanding every day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then Jesus sat with his disciples
at the table of the feast and
said, Behold the lesson of the hour:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> You call me master; such I
am. If, then, your Lord and master
kneel and wash your feet, should
you not wash each other&#8217;s feet and
thus show forth your willingness to
serve?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> You know these things, and
if you do them, blessed thrice are
you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he said, This is an
hour when I can truly praise the
name of God, for I have greatly
wished to eat with you this feast before
I pass the veil;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> For I will eat it not again until
anew I eat it with you in the
kingdom of our Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then they sung the Hebrew
song of praise that Jews were
wont to sing before the feast.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then they ate the pasch
and as they ate, the master said, Behold,
for one of you will turn away
this night and will betray me into
wicked hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And the disciples were
amazed at what he said; they
looked into each other&#8217;s face in
wonderment; they all exclaimed,
Lord, is it I?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Peter said to John, who
sat beside the Lord, To whom does
he refer?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And John put forth his hand
and touched the master&#8217;s hand and
said, Which one of us is so depraved
as to betray his Lord?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">31</span> And Judas said, Lord, is it I?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Jesus said, He is the one
who now has put his hand with
mine into the dish. They looked,
and Judas&#8217; hand was with the hand
of Jesus in the dish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus said, The prophets
cannot fail; the son of man must
be betrayed, but woe to him who
shall betray his Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And from the table Judas
rose at once; his hour had come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And Jesus said to him, Do
quickly what you are to do. And
Judas went his way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And when the pasch was
done the Lord with the eleven sat a
while in silent thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Then Jesus took a loaf of
bread that had been broken not and
said, This loaf is symbol of my body,
and the bread is symbol of the
bread of life;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And as I break this loaf, so
shall my flesh be broken as a pattern
for the sons of men; for men must
freely give their bodies up in willing
sacrifice for other men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And as you eat this bread, so
shall you eat the bread of life, and
never die. And then he gave to
each a piece of bread to eat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And then he took a cup of
wine and said, Blood is the life; this
is the life-blood of the grape; it is
the symbol of the life of him who
gives his life for men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> And as you drink this wine,
if you shall drink in faith, you drink
the life of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> And then he supped and
passed the cup, and the disciples
supped; and Jesus said, This is the
feast of life, the great passover of
the son of man, the Supper of the
Lord, and you shall often eat the
bread and drink the wine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> From henceforth shall this
bread be called Remembrance
bread; this wine shall be Remembrance
wine; and when you eat this
bread and drink this wine remember
me.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> after Judas had gone forth
to meet the emissaries of the
priests and to betray his Lord,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The master said, The hour has

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> My little children, I am with
you yet a little while; soon you will

where I go you cannot come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> I give to you a new command:
As I love you and give my life for
you, so shall you love the world,
and give your life to save the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Love one another as you love
yourselves, and then the world will
know that you are sons of God, disciples
of the son of man whom God
has glorified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Peter said, Lord, where
you go there I will go, for I would
lay my life down for my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus said, Boast not of
bravery, my friend; you are not
strong enough tonight to follow me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Now, Peter, hear! you will
deny me thrice before the cock shall
crow tomorrow morn.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then he looked upon the
eleven and said, You all will be estranged
from me this night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The prophet said, Lo, he will
smite the shepherd of the sheep;
the sheep will flee and hide away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> But after I am risen from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
dead, lo, you will come again, and I
will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Peter said, My Lord,
though every other man forsake
you I will not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Jesus said, O Simon
Peter, lo, your zeal is greater than
your fortitude! Behold, for Satan
cometh up to sift you as a pan of
wheat, but I have prayed that in
your faith you shall not fail; that
after trial you may stand a tower
of strength.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And the disciples all exclaimed,
There is no power on earth
that can estrange, or cause us to
deny our Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, Let not your
hearts be sad; you all believe in
God; believe in me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold, for there are many
mansions in my Fatherland. If
there were not I would have told
you so.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> I go unto my Fatherland,
and will prepare a place for you
that where I am there you may be.
But now you do not know the way
unto my Fatherland.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And Thomas said, We do not
know where you intend to go; how
could we know the way?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus said, I am the
way, the truth, the life; I manifest
the Christ of God. No man can
reach my Fatherland except he
comes with me through Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> If you had known and comprehended
me, then you would
know my Father-God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Philip said, Show us the
Father and we will be satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, Have I been
with you all these years and still
you know me not?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> He who has seen the son has
seen the Father, for in the son the
Father has revealed himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Lo, I have told you many
times that what I speak and what I
do are not the words and works of
man;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> They are the words and
works of God, who lives in me and I
in him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Hear me, you faithful men:
He who believes in me and in my
Father-God shall say and do what
I have said and done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Yea, more, he shall do greater
works than I have ever done, because
I go to him whose works we
do, and then I can reach forth my
hand in helpfulness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And in my name, through
Christ, you may petition God and
he will grant you your request.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Do you believe what I have
said? Yes, you believe, and if you
love the Christ and follow me then
you will keep my words.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> I am the vine; you are the
branches of the vine; my Father is
the husbandman,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The branches that are worthless,
bearing naught but leaves, the
husbandman will cut away and cast
into the fire to be burned.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And he will prune the
branches that bear fruit that they
may yield abundantly.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The branch cannot bear fruit
if separated from the vine; and you
cannot bear fruit when separate
from me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> Abide in me, and do the
works that God, through me, has
taught you how to do, and you will
bear much fruit, and God will honor
you as he has honored me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And now I go my way, but I
will pray my Father-God and he will
send another Comforter to you, who
will abide with you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Behold, this Comforter of

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> John was deeply grieved
because the master said, I go

come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> He wept and said, Lord, I

truth, and man will be the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> When she has come, the Comforter,

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when the Comforter
shall come I need not intercede for
you; for you will stand approved,

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Yea, verily, you will rejoice
as one who welcomes back a brother

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And the disciples said, Our
Lord, speak not in proverbs any
more; speak plainly unto us; we
know that you are wise and know
all things.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> What is the meaning of your
words, I go away, but I will come
again?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, The hour is
come when you will all be scattered
forth, and every man will be afraid;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Will flee to save his life and
leave me all alone; yet I will not be
all alone; my Father-God is with
me all the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And wicked men will take
me to the judgment seat of wicked
men, and in the presence of the multitudes
I will give up my life, a pattern

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> But I will rise again and
come to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">20</span> These things I speak that

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And you shall bear the buffetings
of men, and follow in the
thorny path I tread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Be not dismayed; be of good
cheer. Lo, I have overcome the
world, and you shall overcome the
world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Then Jesus lifted up his eyes
to heaven and said, My Father-God,
the hour has come;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The son of man must now be
lifted from the earth, and may he
falter not, that all the world may
know the power of sacrifice;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> For as I give my life for men,
lo, men must give their lives for
other men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> I came to do thy will, O God,
and in the sacred name, the Christ is
glorified, that men may see the
Christ as life, as light, as love, as
truth,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And through the Christ become
themselves the life, the light,
the love, the truth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> I praise thy name because of
these whom thou hast given me,
for they have honored thee and they
will honor thee;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And none of them are lost,
and none are gone away, except the
blinded son of carnal life, who hath
gone forth to sell his Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> O God, forgive this man, because
he knows not what he does.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And now, O God, I come to
thee, and am no more in mortal life;
keep thou these men to whom I
have made known thy wisdom and
thy love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> As they believe in me, and in
the words I speak, may all the world
believe in them and in the words
they speak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> As thou hast sent me forth
into the world, so I have sent them
forth. I pray that thou wouldst
honor them as thou hast honored
me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> I do not pray that thou
wouldst take them from the world,
but that they may be guarded from
the evil of the world, and not be subject
to temptations that are too
great for them to bear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> They once were of the world,
but now are of the world no more,
as I am of the world no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Thy word is truth, O God,
and by thy word let them be sanctified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> I do not pray for these alone,
O God; I also pray for all who will
believe on me, and will accept the
Christ because of what they do and
say, that they may all be one.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> As I am one with thee, and
thou art one with me, may they be
one with us,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> That all the world may know
that thou hast sent me forth to do
thy will, and that thou lovest them
as thou hast ever loved me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Pilate said, It shall not
be; the sword of Rome will be unsheathed
to save your life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, Nay, Pilate,
nay; there are no armies large
enough in all the world to save my
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus bade the governor
farewell, and went his way; but
Pilate sent a double guard with him
lest he should fall into the hands of
those who were alert to take his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But in a moment Jesus disappeared;
the guards saw him no
more, and in a little while he
reached the brook of Kidron where
the eleven were.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Now, just beyond the brook
there was an orchard and a home
where one, Massalian, lived, where
Jesus oft had been.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Massalian was his friend,
and he believed that Jesus was the
Christ that Jewish prophets long
ago had said would come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Now, in the orchard was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
sacred knoll; Massalian called the
place Gethsemane.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The night was dark, but in
the orchard it was doubly dark and
Jesus bade the eight disciples tarry
by the brook,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> While he, with Peter, James
and John went to Gethsemane to
pray.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> They sat beneath an olive
tree, and Jesus opened up the mysteries
of life to Peter, James and
John. He said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The Spirit of eternity is One
unmanifest; and this is God the
Father, God the Mother, God the
Son in One.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> In life of manifests the One
became the Three, and God the
Father is the God of might; and God
the Mother is omniscient God, and
God the Son is love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And God the Father is the
power of heaven and earth; and
God the Mother is the Holy Breath,
the thought of heaven and earth;
and God the Son, the only son, is
Christ, and Christ is love.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> I came as man to manifest
this love to men,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> As man I have been subject
unto all the trials and temptations
of the human race; but I have overcome
the flesh, with all its passions
and its appetites.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> What I have done all men
can do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And I am now about to demonstrate
the power of man to conquer
death; for every man is God
made flesh.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> I will lay down my life, and
I will take it up again, that you may
know the mysteries of life, of death,
and of the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> I lay me down in flesh, but
I will rise in spirit form with power
to manifest myself so mortal eyes
can see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> So in a trinity of days I will
show forth the all of life, the all of
death, the meaning of the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> And what I do all men can
do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> And you, my three, who constitute
the inner circle of the Church
of Christ, will show to men the attributes
of all the Gods.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> And Peter shall make known
the Power of God; and James shall
show the Thought of God; and John
shall demonstrate the Love of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> Be not afraid of men, for
you have been sent forth to do the
mighty works of God the Father,
God the Mother, God the Son.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> And all the powers of carnal
life cannot destroy your life until
your work is done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> I leave you now, and I will
go out in the darkness all alone and
talk with God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> By sorrow I am overwhelmed.
I leave you here to watch with me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> Then Jesus went three hundred
cubits toward the east, and fell
upon his face and prayed; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> My God! my God! is there a
way by which I may escape the horrors
of the coming hours? My
human flesh shrinks back; my soul
is firm; so not my will, but thine, O
God, be done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> In agony he prayed; the
strain upon the human form was
great; his veins were burst asunder,
and his brow was bathed in blood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">51</span> And then he went back to
the three, and found them all
asleep; he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">52</span> O Simon, Simon, do you
sleep! Could you not watch with
me a single hour? Be vigilant, and
watch and pray that your temptations
be not too great for you to
bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">53</span> I know the spirit is alert and
willing; but the flesh is weak.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">54</span> And then he went again and
prayed, O Father, God! if I must
drink this bitter cup, give me the
strength of body, as I have the
strength of soul; for not my will,
but thine be done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">55</span> And when he went again to
his disciples; lo, he found them still
asleep. He wakened them and
said to James,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">56</span> Have you been sleeping while
your master has been wrestling with
the greatest foe of men? Could
you not watch with me a single
hour?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">57</span> And then he went again and
prayed. O God, I yield to thee;
thy will be done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">58</span> And then again he went back
to the three, and still they slept.
He said to John,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">59</span> With all the love you have
for me, could you not watch with
me a single hour?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">60</span> And then he said, It is
enough; the hour has come, and my
betrayer is at hand; arise and let
us go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">61</span> And when they came again
to Kidron, lo, the eight disciples
were asleep, and Jesus said, You
men, awake; behold, for the betrayer
of the son of man is come.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss.

Jesus is taken unto Jerusalem.
Peter and John follow the mob.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord with the eleven were
in the orchard of Massalian,
and as they talked they saw a band
of men with lanterns and with
swords and clubs approaching them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Jesus said, Behold the
emissaries of the evil one! and
Judas leads the way.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And the disciples said, Lord,
let us flee to save our lives.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> But Jesus said, Why should
we flee to save our lives when this
is the fulfillment of the words of
prophets and of seers?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus went alone to meet
the men; and as they came he said,
Why are you here, you men?
whom do you seek?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And they replied, We seek the
man from Galilee. We seek for
Jesus, one who calls himself the
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And Jesus answered, Here
am I.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then he raised his hands
and with a mighty thought he
brought the ethers to the state of
light; and all the orchard was
aglow with light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The frenzied men were driven
back and many fled and tarried not
until they reached Jerusalem; and
others fell upon their faces on the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The bravest men, and they
with hardest hearts, remained, and
when the light had paled, the Lord
again inquired, Whom do you seek?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Ananias said, We seek
the man from Galilee; we seek for
Jesus, he who calls himself the
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And Jesus answered him and
said, I told you once before; but now
I tell you once again that I am he.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> By Ananias, Judas stood;
but in a moment he had gone and
coming up behind the Lord he said,
My Lord; and then he kissed him as
a sign that he was Jesus whom
they sought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, Do you, Iscariot,
come and thus betray your
master with a kiss?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">15</span> This thing must need be
done; but woe to him who does betray
his Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Your carnal greed has seared
your conscience and you know not
what you do; but in a little time
your conscience will assert itself,
and in remorse, lo, you will close
your span and take your life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then the eleven came, laid
hold of Judas and would have done
him harm; but Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> You must not harm this
man; you have no right to judge
this man; his conscience is his
judge, will sentence him and he will
execute himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And then the mob led on by
Malchus, servant of Caiaphas, laid
hold of Jesus, and was binding him
with chains.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, Why do you
come in dead of night with swords
and clubs to take me in this sacred
place?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Have I not spoken in the
public places of Jerusalem? Have
I not healed your sick, and opened
up your blinded eyes, and made
your lame to walk, your deaf to
hear? You could have found me
any day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And now you try to bind me
down with chains; what are these
chains but links of reeds? And
then he raised his hands; the chains
were broken and they fell to earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Malchus thought the
Lord would flee to save his life, and
with a club he fain would smite him
in the face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> But Peter had a sword, and
rushing up he smote the man and
wounded him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But Jesus said, Stay, Peter,
stay; put up your sword; you are
not called to fight with swords and
clubs. Whoever wields the sword
shall perish by the sword.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> I do not need protection by
the sons of men, for I could call this
moment and a legion, yea, twelve
legions of the messengers of God,
would come and stand in my defense;
but then it is not well.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then he said to Malchus,
Man, I would not have you harmed.
And then he laid his hand upon the
wound that Peter made, and it was
healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Then Jesus said, Be not concerned
lest I should tear myself
away from you and flee to save my
life. I have no wish to save my
life; do with me as you wish.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then the mob rushed up
to seize the eleven to take them
back to stand for trial as the aids of
Jesus in his crimes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> But the disciples, every one
of them, deserted Jesus, and they
fled to save their lives.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Now, John was last to flee;
the mob laid hold of him and tore
his garments all to shreds; but he
escaped in nakedness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> Massalian saw the man, and
took him to his home and gave him
other clothes; and then he followed
after them who led the Lord away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Peter was ashamed because
of his weak cowardice, and
when he was himself again he joined
with John and followed close behind
the mob, and came into Jerusalem.</p>

<i>The Trial and Execution of Jesus.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_165">CHAPTER 165.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus before Caiaphas. Peter denies
his Lord thrice. The indictment,
signed by seven ruling Jews. A
hundred perjured witnesses testify
to the truth of the charges.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Caiaphas</span> was the high priest
of the Jews; the mob led Jesus
to his palace hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The court had been convened,
and all the galleries were packed
with scribes and Pharisees already
sworn as witnesses against the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The maid who kept the palace
door knew John, and this disciple
asked that he and Peter be admitted
to the hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The maid permitted them to
enter in, and John went in; but
Peter was afraid and tarried in the
outer court.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The woman said to Peter, as
he stood beside the door, Are you a
follower of this man from Galilee?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Peter said, No, I am not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The men who had brought
Jesus to the hall sat by a fire in the
outer court, because the night was
cool, and Peter sat with them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Another maid who waited in
the place saw Peter and she said
to him, You surely are from Galilee;
your speech is that of Galilee; you
are a follower of this man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Peter said, I know not
what you mean; I do not even know
this man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then a servant of Caiaphas,
one of those who seized the
Lord and brought him to the court,
saw Peter and he said to him,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Did I not see you in the orchard
of Massalian with this seditious
Nazarene? I&#8217;m sure I did,
and you are one of those who followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Then Peter rose and stamped
upon the floor, and swore by every
sacred thing, that he knew not the
criminal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> Now, John was standing
near and when he heard the words
and knew that Peter had denied his
Lord, he looked at him in sheer
astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Just then a cock crew loud
beneath the court, and Peter called
to mind the words the Lord had
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Before the cock shall crow
tomorrow morn you will deny me
thrice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Peter&#8217;s conscience smote
him heavily, and he went out into
the night and wept.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Caiaphas sat in state; before
him stood the man from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Caiaphas said, You people
of Jerusalem, who is the man that
you accuse?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> They answered: In the name
of every loyal Jew we do accuse this
man from Galilee, this Jesus, who
assumes to be our king, as enemy
of God and man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man,
you are permitted now to speak and
tell about your doctrines and your
claims.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus said, You priest
of carnal man, why do you ask about
my words and works?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Lo, I have taught the multitudes
in every public place; I have
restored your sick to health: have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
opened up your blinded eyes; have
caused your deaf to hear, your lame
to walk, and I have brought your
dead to life again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> My works have not been
done in secret place but in your
public halls and thoroughfares.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> Go ask the people, who have
not been bought with gold or glittering
promises, to tell about my
words and works.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> When Jesus had thus said
a Jewish guard came up and smote
him in the face and said, How dare
you speak thus unto him, the high
priest of the Jews?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, If I have
spoken falsely bear witness unto
what I say; if I have told the truth
why did you smite me thus?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And then Caiaphas said,
What&#8217;er you do, do in a legal way,
for we must answer to a higher
court for everything we do or say.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Let the accusers of this man
present their charges in a legal
form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then Caiaphas&#8217; scribe
stood forth and said, I have the accusations
here in legal form; the
charges made and signed by scribes
and priests and Pharisees.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> Caiaphas said, Be still, you
men, and hear the charges read.
The scribe took up a roll and read:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> To the Sanhedrim of the Jews
and to Caiaphas the high priest,
most honored men:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The highest duty man can
render to his nation and his own is
to protect them from their foes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The people of Jerusalem are
conscious that a mighty foe is in
their very midst.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> A man named Jesus has
come forth and claims to be the heir
to David&#8217;s throne.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> As an impostor he is foe, and
in the name of every loyal Jew we
here submit these charges, which
we are competent to prove:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And first, he blasphemes
God; he says he is the son of God;
that he and God are one;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And he profanes our holy
days by healing, and by doing other
work upon the Sabbath days;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And he proclaims himself the
king, successor of our David and
our Solomon;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And he declares that he will
tear our temple down and build it
up again in form more glorious in
three days;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And he declares that he will
drive the people from Jerusalem,
as he drove out the merchants from
the temple court; and bring to occupy
our sacred hills a tribe of men
that know not God;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> And he avers that every doctor,
scribe and Pharisee and Sadducee,
shall go in exile, and shall
nevermore return;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> And to these charges we do
set our hands and seals.</p>

<ul class="in4">
<li>Annas.</li>
<li>Abinadab.</li>
<li>Joash.</li>
<li>Simon.</li>
<li>Annanias.</li>
<li>Azaniah.</li>
<li>Hezekiah.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> Now, when the scribe had
read the charges, all the people
called for blood; they said, Let such
a wretch be stoned; let him be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> Caiaphas said, You men of
Israel, do you sustain the charges of
these men?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> A hundred men who had
been bribed, stood forth to testify;
they swore that every charge was
true.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man,
have you a word to say? are you
the son of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> And Jesus said, So you have
said; and then he said no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus before the Sanhedrim. Nicodemus
pleads for justice; he shows
the incompetency of the witnesses.
The council fail to declare Jesus
guilty, but Caiaphas, the presiding
judge, declares him guilty. The

to Pilate&#8217;s court.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jesus would not speak,
Caiaphas stood before the
Jewish mob and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Bind fast the prisoner, for he
must go before the great Sanhedrim
of the Jews to answer for his
life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> We cannot execute a criminal
until our findings have been verified
by this, the highest council of the
Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> As soon as it was day the highest
council of the people met; the
Lord and his accusers stood before
the bar.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Caiaphas was the chief; he
rose and said, Let the accusers of
this man from Galilee bring forth
their charges and their evidence.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Caiaphas&#8217; scribe stood forth
and read the charges and the names
of those who had accused the man
from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And all the witnesses were
made to stand and testify before the
council of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And then the lawyers weighed
the evidence, and Nicodemus stood
among the men who plead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> He raised his hands and said,
Let justice now be done, though every
scribe and Pharisee and priest
and Sadducee, as well as Jesus, the
accused, be judged a liar.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> If we can prove this Jesus
to be foe and traitor to our laws and
land, let him be judged a criminal
and suffer for his crimes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> If it be proved that these
who testify are perjurers in the sight
of God and man, then let them be
adjudged as criminals, and let the
man from Galilee go free.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And then he brought the testimonies
of the witnesses before the
judges of the law; no two of them
agreed. In heat of passion, or for
gain, the men had testified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The council would have gladly
judged that Jesus was a criminal
and sentence him to death; but in
the face of all the evidence they
were afraid.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then Caiaphas said, You
man from Galilee, Before the living
God, I now command that you shall
answer me, Are you the Christ, the
son of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, If I would
answer, Yes, you would not hear,
nor yet believe,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> If I would answer, No, I
would be like your witnesses, and
stand a liar in the sight of man and
God. But this I say,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The time will come when you
will see the son of man upon the
throne of power and coming in the
clouds of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then Caiaphas rent his
clothes and said, Have you not
heard enough? Did you not hear
his vile blasphemous words? What
further need have we of witnesses?
What shall we do with him?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The people said, Put him to
death. And then the mob rushed
up and spit into his face, and struck
him with their hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then they bound a cloth
about his eyes and smote him in the
face and said, You are a prophet;
tell us who it was who smote you
in the face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus answered not and
like a lamb before his shearer he,
the man from Galilee, resisted not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Caiaphas said, We cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
put a man to death until the Roman
ruler shall confirm the sentence of
this court;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> So take this criminal away
and Pilate will endorse what we
have done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then was Jesus dragged
along the way up to the palace of
the Roman governor.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Into</span> the palace of the Roman

man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> He has been tried before the
highest council of the Jews and has
been proven traitor to our laws, our
state and to the government of
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> We pray that you will sentence
him to death upon the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> And Pilate said, Why do you
bring him unto me? Go to, and
judge him for yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> You have a law, and by the
sanction of the Roman law, you
have a right to judge and right to
execute.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The Jews replied, We have no
right to execute a man upon the
cross, and since this man is traitor
to Tiberius, our counsellors believe
that he should meet the most humiliating
death&mdash;the death upon
the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> But Pilate said, No man can
be found guilty of a crime by Roman
law until the testimony all is
in, and the accused has been permitted
to defend himself;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> So I will take your bill of
charges, with the evidence you
have, and judge by Roman law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The Jews had made a copy of
the accusations in the language of
the Roman court, and they had
added to the bill:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> We charge that Jesus is an
enemy of Rome; that he demands
that men shall pay no tribute to
Tiberius.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Pilate took the bill; his
guards led Jesus up the steps into
the palace hall.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus stood before the
Roman governor, and Pilate read
to him the charges of the Jews, and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> What is your answer to this
bill? These charges, are they true
or false?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Jesus said, Why should
I plead before an earthly court?
The charges have been verified by
perjured men; what need I say?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Yes, I am king; but carnal
men cannot behold the king, nor see
the kingdom of the God; it is within.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> If I had been a king as carnal
man is king, my servants would
have stood in my defense, and I
would not have willingly surrendered
to the minions of the Jewish
law.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> I have no testimony from
the sons of men. God is my witness,
and my words and deeds bear witness
to the truth;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And every man who comprehends
the truth will hearken to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
words, and in his soul give witness
unto me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Pilate said, What is the
truth?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, Truth is the
God who knows. It is the changeless
one. The Holy Breath is
truth; she changes not and cannot
pass away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Pilate went again unto
the Jews and said, This man is guilty
of no crime; I cannot sentence him
to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then the Jews grew boisterous;
they cried aloud and said,
Our council surely knows. The
wisest men of all the land have
found him guilty of a score of
crimes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> He would pervert the nation
of the Jews; would overthrow the
Roman rule and make himself the
king. He is a culprit come from
Galilee; he must be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Pilate said, If Jesus is
from Galilee he is a subject of the
governor of Galilee, who should be
judge.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Now, Herod had come down
from Galilee and with his suite was
in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Pilate sent to him the
Lord in chains; he also sent a copy
of the charges, and of the testimonies
of the Jews, and asked that
he would pass in judgment on the
case.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And Herod said, I have
heard much about this man and I
am pleased to see him in my court.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And then he asked the Lord
about his claims, about his doctrines
and his aims.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Jesus answered not a
word; and Herod was enraged; he
said, Do you insult the ruler of the
land by answering not?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then he called his guards
and said, Take you this man and
torture him until he answers me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The guards took Jesus and
they smote him; mocked him;
wrapped him in a royal robe; they
made a crown of thorns and put it
on his head; they put a broken reed
into his hands;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And then they said deridingly,
All hail, thou royal king!
Where are your armies and your
guards? Where are your subjects
and your friends?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> But Jesus answered not a
word. Then Herod sent him back
to Pilate with this note of courtesy:</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> Most worthy counsellor of
Rome, I have examined all the
charges and the testimonies that
you sent to me regarding this seditious
man from Galilee, and while I
might adjudge him guilty of the
crimes as charged,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> I yield to you my rights as
judge, because you are superior to
me in power. I will approve of any
judgment you may render in this
case.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Now, Pilate and the tetrarch
had been foes, but the experience
of this hour destroyed their enmity
and they were friends in after
days.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> When Jesus had been
brought again to Pilate&#8217;s court, the
Roman governor stood forth before
the accusers of the Lord and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> I cannot find this Nazarene
to be a criminal as charged; there is
no evidence that he should suffer
death; so I will scourge him well and
let him go.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> The Jews cried angrily, It is
not mete that such a dangerous
man should live; he must be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> Then Pilate said, I bid you
wait a little time. And then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
went into an inner room and sat in
silent thought.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> And as he mused his wife, a
godly woman, chosen from among
the Gauls, came in and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> I pray you, Pilate, hearken
unto me: Beware of what you do
this hour. Touch not this man from
Galilee; he is a holy man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> If you should scourge this
man you scourge the son of God.
Last night I saw it all in vision far
too vivid to be set aside as idle
dream.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> I saw this man walk on the
waters of the sea; I heard him
speak and calm an angry storm; I
saw him flying with the wings of
light;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> I saw Jerusalem in blood; I
saw the statues of the Cæsars fall;
I saw a veil before the sun, and day
was dark as night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> The earth on which I stood
was shaken like a reed before the
wind. I tell you, Pilate, if you
bathe your hands in this man&#8217;s
blood then you may dread the
frowns of great Tiberius, and the
curses of the senators of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> And then she left, and Pilate
wept.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Pilate&#8217;s final effort to release Jesus
fails. He washes his hands in
feigned innocence. Delivers Jesus
to the Jews for execution. The Jewish
soldiers drive him to Calvary.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A</span> superstitious people are
the Jews. They have a faith
that they have borrowed from the
idol worshippers of other lands,
that at the end of every year,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They may heap all their sins
upon the head of some man set
apart to bear their sins.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The man becomes a scapegoat
for the multitudes; and they believe
that when they drive him forth into
the wilds, or into foreign lands, they
are released from sin.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> So every spring before the
feast they chose a prisoner from the
prisons of the land, and by a form
their own, they fain would make
him bear their sins away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> Among the Jewish prisoners
in Jerusalem were three who were
the leaders of a vile, seditious band,
who had engaged in thefts and murders
and rapine, and had been sentenced
to be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Barabbas bar Jezia was
among the men who were to die;
but he was rich and he had bought
of priests the boon to be the scapegoat
for the people at the coming
feast, and he was anxiously in waiting
for his hour to come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Now, Pilate thought to turn
this superstition to account to save
the Lord, and so he went again before
the Jews and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> You men of Israel, according
to my custom I will release to you
today a prisoner who shall bear
your sins away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> This man you drive into the
wilds or into foreign lands, and you
have asked me to release Barabbas,
who has been proven guilty of the
murder of a score of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Now, hear me men, Let Jesus
be released and let Barabbas pay his
debt upon the cross; then you can
send this Jesus to the wilds and hear
no more of him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> At what the ruler said the
people were enraged, and they began
to plot to tear the Roman palace
down and drive in exile Pilate,
and his household and his guards.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> When Pilate was assured
that civil war would follow if he
heeded not the wishes of the mob,
he took a bowl of water and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
presence of the multitude he washed
his hands and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> This man whom you accuse,
is son of the most holy Gods, and
I proclaim my innocence.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> If you would shed his blood,
his blood is on your hands and not
on mine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then the Jews exclaimed,
And let his blood be on
our hands and on our children&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And Pilate trembled like a
leaf, in fear. Barabbas he released
and as the Lord stood forth before
the mob the ruler said, Behold your
king! And would you put to death
your king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The Jews replied, He is no
king; we have no king but great Tiberius.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Now, Pilate would not give
consent that Roman soldiers should
imbue their hands in blood of innocence,
and so the chief priests and
the Pharisees took counsel what to
do with Jesus, who was called the
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Caiaphas said, We cannot
crucify this man; he must be stoned
to death and nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then the rabble said,
Make haste! let him be stoned. And
then they led him forth toward the
hill beyond the city&#8217;s gates, where
criminals were put to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> The rabble could not wait
until they reached the place of
skulls. As soon as they had passed
the city&#8217;s gate, they rushed upon
him, smote him with their hands,
they spit upon him, stoned him and
he fell upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And one, a man of God, stood
forth and said, Isaiah said, He shall
be bruised for our transgressions
and by his stripes we shall be healed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> As Jesus lay all bruised and
mangled on the ground a Pharisee
called out, Stay, stay you men! behold,
the guards of Herod come and
they will crucify this man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And there beside the city&#8217;s
gate they found Barabbas&#8217; cross;
and then the frenzied mob cried out,
Let him be crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Caiaphas and the other ruling
Jews came forth and gave consent.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And then they lifted Jesus
from the ground, and at the point of
swords they drove him on.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> A man named Simon, from
Cyrene, a friend of Jesus, was a-near
the scene and since the bruised and
wounded Jesus could not bear his
cross, they laid it on the shoulders
of this man and made him bear it on
to Calvary.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> Judas who betrayed his
Lord, was with the mob; but
all the time he thought that Jesus
would assert his power and demonstrate
the strength of God that he
possessed, and strike to earth the
fiendish multitudes and free himself;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> But when he saw his master
on the ground and bleeding from a
score of wounds, he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> O God, what have I done?
I have betrayed the son of God; the
curse of God will rest upon my soul.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And then he turned and ran
with haste until he reached the
temple door; he found the priests,
who gave to him the thirty silver
pieces to betray the Lord, and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">5</span> Take back your bribe; it is
the cost price of my soul; I have betrayed

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The priests replied, That matters
not to us.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Then Judas threw the silver
on the floor, and, bowed with grief,
he went away, and on a ledge beyond
the city&#8217;s walls he hanged himself
and died.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> In time the fastenings gave
way, his body fell into the Hinnon
vale and after many days they
found it there a shapeless mass.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The rulers could not put the
price of blood into the treasury, and
so they took the thirty silver pieces
with which they bought a potter&#8217;s
field,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Where they might bury those
who had no rights to lie within their
sacred burial grounds.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And there they put the body

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> Jewish mob pushed on toward
Calvary and as they went
the Marys, Miriam, and other
women not a few, were close beside
the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> They wept aloud. When Jesus
saw them weeping and lamenting
thus he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> Weep not for me, for though I
go away, go through the gateway
of the cross, yet on the next day of
the sun, lift up your hearts, for I
will meet you at the sepulchre.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The great procession came to
Calvary. The Roman soldiers had
already bound the two state prisoners
to the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> (They were not nailed, but
simply bound.)</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Four soldiers of the Roman
guard that Herod brought from
Galilee were called to execute the
orders of the court.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> These were the men who had
been set apart to torture Jesus and
secure from him confession of his
guilt.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> These were the men who
scourged him, put a crown of thorns
upon his head, a broken reed into
his hands, and wrapped him in a
royal robe, and bowed in mockery,
before him as a king.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> These soldiers took the Lord
and stripped him, laid him on the
cross and would have bound him
there with cords; but this would not
suffice.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The cruel Jews were near
with hammer and with nails; they
cried, not cords, but nails; drive fast
the nails and hold him to the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And then the soldiers took
the nails and drove them through
his feet and hands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> They offered him a sedative
to drink, a draught of vinegar and
myrrh; but he refused to drink the
draught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The soldiers had prepared a
place in which to plant Barabbas&#8217;
cross between the other criminals;
and here they raised the cross of
Jesus, who was called the Christ;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And then the soldiers and the
mob sat down to watch him die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus said, My Father-God,
forgive these men; they know
not what they do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Now, Pilate had prepared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
tablet to be placed upon the cross
on which was written in the tongues
of Hebrew, Latin and the Greek
these words of truth: JESUS THE
CHRIST, KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And this was placed upon the
cross. The priests were angered
when they read these words upon
the tablet of the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then they prayed that
Pilate would not say, He is the
Christ, king of the Jews; but say,
He claims to be the Christ, king of
the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> But Pilate said, What I have
written, I have written; let it stand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The Jewish multitudes who
saw the Lord upon the cross were
wild with joy; they said, All hail,
fake king!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> You who would tear the
temple down and in three days
would build it up again, why don&#8217;t
you save yourself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> If you are Christ, the son of
God, come from the cross; then all
men will believe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The priests and scribes and
Pharisees looked on the scene and
scoffed; they said, He rescued others
from the grave; why don&#8217;t he save
himself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> The Jewish soldiers and the
Roman guards who came from Galilee
were loud in mocking and deriding
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> One of the other men upon
the cross joined in the mockery; he
said, If you are Christ, you have the
power; just speak the Word, and
save yourself and me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> The other man upon the
cross rebuked the man; he said, You
wretch! have you no fear of God?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> This man is innocent of any
crime while you and I are guilty and
are paying up the debts we owe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And then he said to Jesus,
Lord, I know thy kingdom comes,
the kingdom that the world can
never comprehend;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And when thou comest on the
clouds of heaven, remember me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And Jesus said, Behold, for
I will meet you in the realm of souls
this day.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Now, standing near unto the
cross were many women from Judea
and from Galilee. Among them
were the mother of the Lord and
Miriam,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And Mary, mother of the two
apostles, James and John, and Mary
Magdalene, and Martha, Ruth and
Mary, and Salome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> When Jesus saw his mother
and the singer Miriam standing
close beside the cross and John a-near,
he said to John,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> In your most tender care I
leave my mother and my sister
Miriam.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And John replied, While they
shall live my home shall be the
home of your thrice blessed mother
and your sister Miriam.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> According to a custom of the
Jews, to those who were the executioners
of law and took the lives of
criminals, belonged the garments of
the criminals.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> So when the Lord was crucified,
the Roman guards divided
up among themselves the garments
of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> But when they found his coat
it was a seamless coat and highly
prized.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> For it the guards cast lots,
and thus determined who should
have the prize.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And thus the scripture was
fulfilled, which said, And they divided
all my robes among themselves,
and for my vesture they cast
lots.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And when the sun refused to

watched the body on the cross exclaimed,
This surely was the son of

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then the people hurried
down from Calvary. The priests,
the Pharisees and scribes were filled
with fear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> They sought the cover of
their synagogues and homes and
said, Behold, the wrath of God!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The great day of the Jewish

Pilate&#8217;s feet and prayed that they
might take the body of the Nazarene
and lay it in a tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Pilate gave consent.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Now, Joseph had prepared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
costly mixture to embalm the body
of the Lord, about a hundred
pounds of aloes and of myrrh, and
this they took and hastened out to
Calvary.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And when the guards returned
they said, The Nazarene is
dead; the malefactors are alive.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And Pilate told the guards
to go and smite the living men so
they would die, and then to give
their bodies to the flames; but give
the body of the Nazarene to rabbis
who would call for it.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> The soldiers did as Pilate
said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The rabbis came and took
away the body of the Lord and
when they had prepared it with the
spices they had bought,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> They laid it in the new-made
tomb that had been made for Joseph
in a solid rock.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then they rolled a stone
up to the sepulcher.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> The priests were fearful lest
the friends of Jesus would go forth
at night and take away the body of
the Nazarene, and then report that
he had risen from the dead, as he
had said;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And they requested that the
governor would send his soldiers to
the tomb to guard the body of the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> But Pilate said, I will not
send a Roman guard; but you have
Jewish soldiers and may send a hundred
men with a centurion to guard
the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And then they sent a hundred
soldiers out to guard the tomb.</p>

<i>The Resurrection of Jesus.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_172">CHAPTER 172.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Pilate places the Roman seal upon
the stone door of the tomb. At midnight
a company of the silent
brothers march about the tomb.
The soldiers are alarmed. Jesus
preaches to the spirits in prison.
Early Sunday morning he rises
from the tomb. The soldiers are
bribed by the priests to say that the
disciples had stolen the body.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> tomb in which they laid the
body of the Lord was in a garden,
rich with flowers, the garden
of Siloam, and Joseph&#8217;s home was
near.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> Before the watch began Caiaphas
sent a company of priests out
to the garden of Siloam that they
might be assured that Jesus&#8217; body
was within the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They rolled away the stone;
they saw the body there, and then
they placed the stone again before
the door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And Pilate sent his scribe
who placed upon the stone the seal
of Rome, in such a way that he
who moved the stone would break
the seal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> To break this Roman seal
meant death to him who broke the
seal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The Jewish soldiers all were
sworn to faithfulness; and then the
watch began.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> At midnight all was well, but
suddenly the tomb became a blaze
of light, and down the garden walk
a troupe of white clad soldiers
marched in single file.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> They came up to the tomb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and marched and countermarched
before the door.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The Jewish soldiers were alert;
they thought the friends had come
to steal the body of the Nazarene.
The captain of the guard cried out
to charge.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> They charged; but not a
white clad soldier fell. They did
not even stop; they marched and
countermarched among the frightened
men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> They stood upon the Roman
seal; they did not speak; they unsheathed
not their swords; it was
the Silent Brotherhood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The Jewish soldiers fled in
fear; they fell upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> They stood apart until the
white clad soldiers marched away,
and then the light about the tomb
grew dim.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Then they returned; the
stone was in its place; the seal was
not disturbed, and they resumed
their watch.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Now, Jesus did not sleep
within the tomb. The body is the
manifest of soul; but soul is soul
without its manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And in the realm of souls,
unmanifest, the Lord went forth
and taught.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> He opened up the prison
doors and set the prisoners free;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> He broke the chains of captive
souls, and led the captives to
the light;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> He sat in council with the
patriarchs and prophets of the olden
times;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> The masters of all times and
climes he met, and in the great assemblies
he stood forth and told
the story of his life on earth, and of
his death in sacrifice for man,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And of his promises to clothe
himself again in garb of flesh and
walk with his disciples, just to prove
the possibilities of man;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> To give to them the key of
life, of death, and of the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> In council all the masters
sat and talked about the revelations
of the coming age,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> When she, the Holy Breath,
shall fill the earth and air with holy
breath, and open up the way of man
to perfectness and endless life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> The garden of Siloam was
silent on the Sabbath day; the Jewish
soldiers watched and no one
else approached the tomb; but on
the following night the scene was
changed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> At midnight every Jewish
soldier heard a voice which said,
<i>Adon Mashich Cumi</i>, which meant,
Lord Christ arise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And they supposed again
that friends of Jesus were alert,
were coming up to take the body
of their Lord away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> The soldiers were alert with
swords unsheathed and drawn, and
then they heard the words again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> It seemed as though the
voice was everywhere, and yet they
saw no man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The soldiers blanched with
fear, and still to flee meant death
for cowardice, and so they stood
and watched.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> Again, and this was just before
the sun arose, the heavens
blazed with light, a distant thunder
seemed to herald forth a coming
storm;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then the earth began to
quake and in the rays of light they
saw a form descend from heaven,
They said, Behold an angel comes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And then they heard again,
<i>Adon Mashich Cumi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And then the white-robed
form tramped on the Roman seal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and then he tore it into shreds; he
took the mighty stone in hand as
though it were a pebble from the
brook, and cast it to the side.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And Jesus opened up his
eyes and said, All hail the rising
sun! the coming of the day of righteousness!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And then he folded up his
burial gown, his head bands and his
coverings and laid them all aside.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> He rose, and for a moment
stood beside the white-robed form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> The weaker soldiers fell upon
the ground, and hid their faces in
their hands; the stronger stood and
watched.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> They saw the body of the
Nazarene transmute; they saw it
change from mortal to immortal
form, and then it disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> The soldiers heard a voice
from somewhere; yea, from everywhere,
it said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> Peace, peace on earth; good
will to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> They looked, the tomb was
empty and the Lord had risen as he
said.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> The soldiers hastened to
Jerusalem, and to the priests, and
said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> Behold, the Nazarene has
risen as he said; the tomb is empty
and the body of the man is gone;
we know not where it is. And then
they told about the wonders of the
night.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> Caiaphas called a council of
the Jews; he said, the news must
not go forth that Jesus has arisen
from the dead;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> For if it does all men will
say, He is the son of God, and all
our testimonies will be proven false.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> And then they called the
hundred soldiers in and said to
them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">48</span> You know not where the
body of the Nazarene is resting
now, so if you will go forth and say
that his disciples came and stole
the body while you slept,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">49</span> Each one of you shall have
a silver piece, and we will make it
right with Pilate for the breaking
of the Roman seal.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">50</span> The soldiers did as they were
paid to do.</p>

<i>Materialization of the Spiritual Body of Jesus.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_173">CHAPTER 173.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus appears, fully materialized, to
his mother, Miriam, Mary of Magdala
and to Peter, James and John.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when the rabbis took the
body of the Lord and laid it
in the tomb the mother of the Lord,
and Mary Magdalene, and Miriam
were there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And when the body was entombed
they went to Joseph&#8217;s home
and there abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> They did not know that Jewish
soldiers had been sent to guard
the tomb, nor that the Roman seal
was placed upon the stone;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> So in the morning of the first
day of the week they hastened to the
tomb with spices to embalm the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> But when they reached the
tomb they found the terror-stricken
soldiers running frantically about.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The women did not know the
cause; but when they found an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
empty tomb they were excited and
aggrieved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The soldiers did not know
what had transpired; they could not
tell who took the body of the Lord
away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Mary Magdalene ran with
haste toward Jerusalem to tell the
news to Peter and the rest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> She met, just by the gateway,
Peter, James and John; she said,
Some one has rolled away the stone
and carried off the body of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And then the three disciples
ran toward the tomb; but John was
fleet of foot and was the first to
reach the tomb; he found it empty;
the body of his Lord was gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> When Peter came he went
into the tomb, and found the grave
clothes neatly folded up and laid
aside.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, the disciples did not
comprehend the scene. They did
not know the meaning of their Lord
when he informed them just before
his death that he would rise from
death upon the first day of the
week.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> The three disciples went back
to Jerusalem; the mother of the
Lord and Miriam went not away.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Mary looked within the
tomb, and saw two masters sitting
there; they said, Why do you weep?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Mary said, Because my
Lord is gone; some one has carried
off the body of my Lord; I know
not where it is.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then she arose and looked
around; a man stood near and said,
Why do you weep? whom do you
seek?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Mary thought it was the
gardener and said, If you have
borne away the body of my Lord,
O tell me where it is that I may lay
it in a sacred tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then the man came near
and said, My mother! and Mary
said, My Lord!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> The eyes of Miriam were
opened up and she beheld the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And Jesus said, Behold, I
told you as we walked along the way
up to the cross that I would meet
you at the sepulcher upon the first
day of the week.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Now, Mary Magdalene was
sitting not a great way off, and
Jesus went to her and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Why seek the living &#8217;mong
the dead? Your Lord has risen as
he said. Now, Mary, look! behold
my face!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Then Mary knew it was the
Lord; that he had risen from the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then Salome, and Mary,
mother of the two disciples, James
and John, Joanna, and the other
women who had come out to the
tomb, saw Jesus, and they talked
with him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And Mary Magdalene was
filled with joy. She sought again
for Peter, James and John; she
found them and she said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> Lo, I have seen the Lord;
and Miriam has seen the Lord; the
mother of the Lord has seen the
Lord; and many more have seen his
face; for he has risen from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> But the disciples thought
that she had simply seen a vision of
the Lord. They did not think that
he had risen from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Then Mary found the other
members of the company and told
them all about the risen Lord; but
none of them believed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Now, Peter, James and John
were in the garden of Siloam; were
talking with the gardener about
the happenings of the day when
John beheld a stranger coming up
the walk.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The stranger lifted up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
hands and said, I am. Then the
disciples knew it was the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> And Jesus said, Behold, for
human flesh can be transmuted into
higher form, and then that higher
form is master of things manifest,
and can, at will, take any form.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And so I come to you in
form familiar unto you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> Go speak to Thomas, and the
other men whom I have called to
be apostles unto men, and say to
them,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> That he whom Jews and Romans
thought was dead is walking
in the garden of Siloam;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> Will stand again before the
priests and Pharisees within the
temple in Jerusalem;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> And will appear unto the
sages of the world.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Tell them that I will go before
them into Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> Then Peter, James and John
went forth and found their brethren,
and said, Behold, the Lord is risen
from the dead, and we have seen
him face to face.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> The brethren were amazed
at what the three disciples said; but
still they looked upon their words
as idle talk and they believed them
not.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus appears, fully materialized, to
Zachus and Cleophas as they
journey to Emmaus, but they
know him not. He tells them many
things about Christ. He eats the
evening meal with them, and reveals
himself to them. They go to
Jerusalem and tell the news.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the evening of the
resurrection day, two friends of
Jesus, Zachus and Cleophas of Emmaus,
seven miles away, were going
to their home.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And as they walked and
talked about the things that had occurred
a stranger joined their company.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> He said, My friends, you seem
discouraged and are sad. Has some
great grief upon you come?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Cleophas said, Are you a
stranger in Judea, and know not of
the thrilling things that have transpired
here?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The stranger said, What
things? To what do you refer?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Cleophas said, Have you not
heard about the man from Galilee
who was a prophet mighty in both
word and deed?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> A man whom many thought
had come to found again the kingdom
of the Jews, and drive the Romans
from the city of Jerusalem
and be himself the king?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The stranger said, Tell me
about this man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> Cleophas said, His name was
Jesus; he was born in Bethlehem;
his home was up in Galilee. He
loved the people as he loved himself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> He was, in truth, a master
sent from God, for he had matchless
power. He healed the sick and
made the deaf to hear, the blind to
see, the lame to walk, and even
raised the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> The Jewish scribes and Pharisees
were jealous of his fame and
power, and they arrested him; by
perjured witnesses they proved him
guilty of a score of crimes,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And on last Friday he was
taken to the place of skulls and crucified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> He died and he was buried in
a rich man&#8217;s tomb, out in the garden
of Siloam.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> This very morning when his
friends went to the tomb they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
it empty; the body of the Lord was
gone.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And now the news has spread
abroad that he has risen from the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> The stranger said, Yes, I
have heard about this man; but it
seems strange that after all the
things that Jewish prophets long
ago foretold concerning him that
when he came men knew him not.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> This man was born to demonstrate
the Christ to men, and it is
just to say that Jesus is the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> According to the Word, this
Jesus came to suffer at the hands of
men, to give his life as pattern for
the sons of men;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> To rise from death that men
might know the way to rise from
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And then the stranger told
the two disciples all about the Law,
the Prophets and the Psalms, and
read to them a multitude of things
that had been written of this man
from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And now the men had
reached their home and as the
night was near they importuned
the stranger to abide with them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And he went in with them
and as they sat about the table at
the evening meal, he took a piece of
bread, and blessed it in the name of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And instantly their eyes were
opened up, and they perceived that
he, the stranger, was the Lord, the
man from Galilee; that he had risen
from the dead; and then the form of
Jesus disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> When he had gone, the two
disciples were amazed. They said,
Did not our hearts burn with delight
while he was talking to us by
the way and opening up the testimonies
of the Law, the Prophets and
the Psalms?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Then Zachus and Cleopas
went back to Jerusalem, and everywhere
they went they said, Lo, we
have seen the Lord;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> He walked with us to Emmaus;
he ate with us the evening
meal, and broke for us the bread of
life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> evening of the resurrection
day had come; the ten apostles
were in Simon&#8217;s house in Bethany.
The lawyer, Thomas, was not there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The doors were closed and
barred, because the Jews had said
that they would drive the Galileans

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And as they talked, lo, Jesus

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And the disciples shrank in
fear; they thought it was a phantom
that they saw.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Jesus said, Why are you
troubled thus? why do you fear? I
am no phantom form. I am your
Lord, and I have risen from the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> I often said, I will arise; but
you believed me not; and now come

flesh and bones and brawn, like I
possess.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Come now, and clasp my
hands, and touch my feet, and lay
your hands upon my head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And every one came up and
clasped his hands, and touched his
feet, and laid his hands upon his
head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, Have you
here anything to eat?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And they brought out a fragment
of a fish; he ate it in the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
of them all, and then the ten
believed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> Nathaniel said, And now we
know that he has risen from the
dead; he stands a surety of the resurrection
of the dead. And Jesus
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth
and Lazarus were in their home,
and they had heard the rumor that
their Lord had risen from the dead,
and Martha said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> It cannot be, for such a thing
has never happened since the world
began.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But Mary said, Did not the
Lord bring back our brother from
the dead? and he could surely bring
himself to life again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And as they talked, the Lord
stood in their midst and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> All hail! for I am risen from
the dead, first fruitage of the grave!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> And Martha ran and brought
the chair in which the Lord had
ever loved to sit, and Jesus sat
down on the chair.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And for a long, long time
they talked about the trial, and the
scenes of Calvary and of the garden
of Siloam.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> A halo rested on his head, and
light, unlike the light of sun, filled
all the room.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The wise men rose and bowed
their heads and said, All hail!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Jesus sat down in the
vacant chair; and then the wise men
knew it was the Hebrew prophet
who had come.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And Jesus said, Behold, for I
am risen from the dead. Look at
my hands, my feet, my side.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The Roman soldiers pierced
my hands and feet with nails; and
then one pierced my heart.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> They put me in a tomb, and
then I wrestled with the conqueror
of men. I conquered death, I
stamped upon him and arose;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Brought immortality to light
and painted on the walls of time a
rainbow for the sons of men; and
what I did all men shall do.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> This gospel of the resurrection
of the dead is not confined
to Jew and Greek; it is the heritage
of every man of every time and
clime; and I am here a demonstration
of the power of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Then he arose and pressed
the hand of every man and of the
royal host, and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">17</span> Behold, I am not myth made
of the fleeting winds, for I am flesh
and bone and brawn; but I can cross
the borderland at will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then they talked together
there a long, long time.
Then Jesus said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> I go my way, but you shall
go to all the world and preach the
gospel of the omnipotence of man,
the power of truth, the resurrection
of the dead;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> He who believes this gospel
of the son of man shall never die;
the dead shall live again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then Jesus disappeared, but
he had sown the seed. The words
of life were spoken in Orissa, and
all of India heard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The magian priests were in
the silence in Persepolis, and Kaspar,
and the magian masters who
were first to greet the child of promise
in the shepherd&#8217;s home in Bethlehem,
were with the priests.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus came and sat with
them; a crown of light was on his
head.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And when the silence ended
Kaspar said, A master from the
royal council of the Silent Brotherhood
is here; let us give praise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> And all the priests and masters
stood and said, All hail! What
message from the royal council do
you bring?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus said, My brothers
of the Silent Brotherhood, peace,
peace on earth; good will to men!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The problem of the ages has
been solved; a son of man has risen
from the dead; has shown that human
flesh can be transmuted into
flesh divine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Before the eyes of men this
flesh in which I come to you was
changed with speed of light from
human flesh. And so I am the
message that I bring to you.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> To you I come, the first of all
the race to be transmuted to the
image of the AM.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> What I have done, all men
will do; and what I am, all men
will be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> But Jesus said no more. In
one short breath he told the story
of his mission to the sons of men,
and then he disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> The magi said, Some time
ago we read this promise, now fulfilled,
upon the dial plate of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And then we saw this man
who has just demonstrated unto us
the power of man to rise from carnal
flesh and blood to flesh of God, a
babe in Bethlehem.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> And after many years he
came and sat with us in these same
groves;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> He told the story of his human
life, of trials, sore temptations,
buffetings and woes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> He pressed along the thorny
way of life till he had risen and o&#8217;erthrown
the strongest foes of God
and man; and he is now the only
master of the human race whose
flesh has been transmuted into flesh
divine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> He is the God-man of today;
but every one of earth shall
overcome and be like him, a son of
God.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus appears, fully materialized, in

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the Sabbath day and many
priests and scribes and Pharisees
were in the temple in Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Caiaphas, Annas and some
other ruling Jews were there.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> A stranger came in garb of
fisherman and asked, What has become
of Jesus who is called the
Christ? Is he not teaching in the
temple now?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The Jews replied, That man
from Galilee was crucified a week
ago, because he was a dangerous
man, a vile, seditious man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The stranger asked, Where
did you put the body of this man
from Galilee? where is his tomb?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> The Jews replied, We do not
know. His followers came at night
and stole the body from the tomb
in which it lay and carried it away,
and then declared that he had risen
from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The stranger asked, How do
you know that his disciples stole
the body from the tomb? was any
one a witness of the theft?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> The Jews replied, We had a
hundred soldiers at the place, and
every one of them declares that his
disciples stole the body from the
tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The stranger asked, Will any
one of all your hundred men stand
forth and say, I saw the body stolen
from the tomb?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> The Jews replied, We do not
know; these men are men of truth;
we cannot doubt their word.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> The stranger said, You
priests and scribes and Pharisees
hear me: I was a witness of the facts,
was in the garden of Siloam, and
stood among your hundred men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And this I know that not a
man among your hundred men, will
say, I saw the body stolen from the
tomb.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> And I will testify before the
God of heaven and earth, The body
was not stolen from the tomb; the
man from Galilee is risen from the
dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then the priests and
scribes and Pharisees rushed up to
seize the man and cast him out.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> But instantly the fisherman
became a radiant form of light, and
priests and scribes and Pharisees
fell back in deadly fear; they saw
the man from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And Jesus looked upon the
frightened men and said, This is the
body that you stoned beyond the
city&#8217;s gates and crucified on Calvary.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Behold my hands, my feet,
my side and see the wounds the
soldiers made.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> If you believe that I am
phantom made of air, come forth
and handle me; ghosts do not
carry flesh and bones.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> I came to earth to demonstrate
the resurrection of the dead,
the transmutation of the flesh of
carnal man to flesh of man divine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Then Jesus raised his hands
and said, Peace be to every one of
you; good will to all mankind. And
then he disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Now, Thomas had not seen
the Lord since he had risen from
the dead, and when the ten averred
that they had seen and talked with
him he said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Until I see the nail prints in
his hands and feet, the spear wound
in his side, and talked with him as
I have talked with him before, I
cannot have a reason to believe that
he is risen from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> At Simon&#8217;s house in Bethany
the men from Galilee had met. It
was the evening of the first day of
the week, and on the morrow all
would turn their faces toward their
homes.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> The eleven apostles all were
there; the doors were closed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
barred, and Jesus came and said,
Peace be to all!</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then he said to Thomas,
friend, you do not know that I
have risen from the dead; the time
has come for you to know.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Come here and see the nail
prints in my hands, the spear
wound in my side, and talk with
me as you have often talked with
me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Thomas came and saw,
and then exclaimed, My master,
and my Lord! I do not now believe,
I know that you are risen
from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> And Jesus said, Because you
see me you believe, and blessed are
your eyes;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> But blessed thrice are they
who see me not and yet believe.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> Then Jesus vanished from
their sight, but the disciples were
established in their faith.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_178">CHAPTER 178.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Jesus appears, fully materialized,
before Apollo and the Silent Brotherhood
in Greece. Appears to
Claudas and Juliet on the Tiber
near Rome. Appears to the priests
in the Egyptian temple at Heliopolis.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap">Apollo,</span> with the Silent Brotherhood
of Greece, was sitting
in a Delphian grove. The Oracle
had spoken loud and long.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The priests were in the sanctuary
and as they looked the Oracle
became a blaze of light; it seemed
to be on fire, and all consumed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The priests were filled with
fear. They said, A great disaster
is to come; our gods are mad; they
have destroyed our Oracle.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> But when the flames had spent
themselves, a man stood on the
orac pedestal and said;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> God speaks to man, not by an
oracle of wood and gold, but by the
voice of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> The gods have spoken to the
Greeks, and kindred tongues,
through images made by man; but
God, the One, now speaks to man
through Christ the only son, who
was, and is and evermore will be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> This Oracle shall fail; the Living
Oracle of God, the One, will
never fail.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> Apollo knew the man who
spoke; he knew it was the Nazarene
who once had taught the wise men
in the Acropolis and had rebuked
the idol worshippers upon the
Athen&#8217;s beach;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And in a moment Jesus stood
before Apollo and the Silent Brotherhood,
and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Behold, for I have risen from
the dead with gifts for men. I
bring to you the title of your vast
estate.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> All power in heaven and
earth is mine; to you I give all
power in heaven and earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Go forth and teach the nations
of the earth the gospel of the
resurrection of the dead and of
eternal life through Christ, the love
of God made manifest to men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And then he clasped Apollo&#8217;s
hand and said, My human flesh was
changed to higher form by love divine
and I can manifest in flesh, or
in the higher planes of life, at will.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> What I can do all men can
do. Go preach the gospel of the
omnipotence of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> Then Jesus disappeared; but
Greece and Crete and all the nations
heard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Claudas and Juliet, his wife,
lived on the Palatine in Rome and
they were servants of Tiberius; but
they had been in Galilee;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Had walked with Jesus by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the sea, had heard his words and
seen his power; and they believed
that he was Christ made manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> Now Claudas and his wife
were on the Tiber in a little boat; a
storm swept from the sea, the boat
was wrecked and Claudas and his
wife were sinking down to death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> And Jesus came and took
them by the hands and said, Claudas
and Juliet, arise and walk with
me upon the waves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> And they arose and walked
with him upon the waves.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> A thousand people saw the
three walk on the waves, and saw
them reach the land, and they were
all amazed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> And Jesus said, You men of
Rome, I am the resurrection and the
life. They that are dead shall live,
and many that shall live will never
die.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> By mouth of gods and demigods
God spoke unto your fathers
long ago; but now he speaks to you
through perfect man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> He sent his son, the Christ,
in human flesh, to save the world,
and as I lifted from the watery
grave and saved these servants of
Tiberius,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> So Christ will lift the sons
and daughters of the human race,
yea, every one of them, from darkness
and from graves of carnal
things, to light and everlasting life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> I am the manifest of love
raised from the dead; Behold my
hands, my feet, my side which carnal
men have pierced.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Claudas and Juliet, whom I
have saved from death, are my ambassadors
to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And they will point the way
and preach the gospel of the Holy
Breath and of the resurrection of
the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And that was all he said, but
Rome and all of Italy heard.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> The priests of Heliopolis
were in their temple met to celebrate
the resurrection of their
brother Nazarite; they knew that he
had risen from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> The Nazarite appeared and
stood upon a sacred pedestal on
which no man had ever stood.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> This was an honor that had
been reserved for him who first
would demonstrate the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Jesus was the first of all
the human race to demonstrate
the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> When Jesus stood upon the
sacred pedestal the masters stood
and said, All hail! The great bells
of the temple rang and all the temple
was ablaze with light.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> And Jesus said, All honor to
the masters of this Temple of the
Sun.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> In flesh of man there is the
essence of the resurrection of the
dead. This essence, quickened by
the Holy Breath, will raise the substance
of the body to a higher tone,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> And make it like the substance
of the bodies of the planes
above, which human eyes cannot
behold.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> There is a holy ministry in
death. The essence of the body
cannot be quickened by the Holy
Breath until the fixed is solved; the
body must disintegrate, and this is
death.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> And then upon these pliant
substances God breathes, just as he
breathed upon the chaos of the deep
when worlds were formed,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And life springs forth from
death; the carnal form is changed
to form divine.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">41</span> The will of man makes possible
the action of the Holy Breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
When will of man and will of God
are one, the resurrection is a fact.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">42</span> In this we have the chemistry
of mortal life, the ministry of
death, the mystery of deific life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">43</span> My human life was wholly
given to bring my will to tune with
the deific will; when this was done
my earth-tasks all were done.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">44</span> And you, my brothers, know
full well the foes I had to meet; you
know about my victories in Gethsemane;
my trials in the courts of
men; my death upon the cross.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">45</span> You know that all my life
was one great drama for the sons
of men; a pattern for the sons of
men. I lived to show the possibilities
of man.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">46</span> What I have done all men
can do, and what I am all men
shall be.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">47</span> The masters looked; the
form upon the sacred pedestal had
gone, but every temple priest, and
every living creature said, Praise
God.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> the apostles were at home

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Peter, James and John,

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> And as they neared the shore
a man stood on the shore and said,

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> And Peter answered, None.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Again the man called out and
said, A school of fish is passing now

filled; and John exclaimed, It is the
Lord who stands upon the shore.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> And Peter plunged into the
sea and swam to shore. The other
men brought in the net, and it contained
a hundred fifty and three fish
and yet it did not break.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And Jesus said, My children,
let us break our fast together here.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> They found some living coals
upon the beach and Peter brought
and dressed the fish; they had some
bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> And when the meal had been
prepared they broke their fast, and
Jesus ate of both the fish and bread.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> Now, after breakfast all the
men were sitting on the beach, and
Jesus said to Peter, Do you love the
Lord your God with all your heart,
and do you love your neighbor as
you love yourself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And Peter said, Yea, Lord,
I love the Lord my God with all my
heart; I love my neighbor as I love

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> And Jesus said, Then feed
my sheep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And then he said to James,
Do you love her, the Holy Breath,
with all your heart, and do you love
your neighbor as you love yourself?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And James replied, Yea,
Lord, I love the Holy Breath with
all my heart; I love my neighbor as
I love myself.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Then Jesus said, Protect my
sheep.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And then he said to John,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> Then Jesus rose and said to
Peter, Follow me. And Peter followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> When Peter saw that John
was following him he said to Jesus,
Lord, behold, John follows you!
What shall he do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Now Peter did not hear the
master when he said to John, Then
feed my lambs.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And Jesus spoke to Peter
and he said, It matters not to you
what John shall do; not even though
I will that he remain until I come
again.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> Just do your duty; follow me.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And Jesus passed, they knew
not where he went.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> The news soon spread
through all Capernaum that Jesus
had arisen from the dead, that he
had walked with his disciples by
the sea, and ate with them the
morning meal. The multitudes
came forth to see.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> Now Peter, James and John,
together with the other men who
had been called to be apostles of the

Capernaum to pray,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> And now I will ascend to
God, as you and all the world will
rise to God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Behold, upon the day of Pentecost
you all shall be endowed with
power from on high.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> But here you shall remain
till then in holy thought and prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> Then Jesus went to Olivet,
and his disciples followed him, and
in a place not far removed from
Bethany, he met the Marys and
Salome;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> Met Martha, Ruth and Miriam;
met Lazarus and a host of
others who had come from Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> And Jesus stood apart and
raised his hands and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> The benedictions of the Holy
Ones, of the Almighty God, and of
the Holy Breath, of Christ the love
of God made manifest,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> Will rest upon you all the
way till you shall rise and sit with
me upon the throne of power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> And then they saw him rise
upon the wings of light; a wreath
encircled him about; and then they
saw his form no more.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But as they gazed up into
heaven two men, in robes of white,
appeared and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> You men of Galilee, why
gaze you thus so anxiously upon the
ascending Lord? Lo, he will come
again from heaven as you have seen
him go to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> Then the eleven and Lazarus,
and the other men from Galilee, together
with the faithful women, not
a few, returned unto Jerusalem and
there abode.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> And they were constantly in
prayer and holy thought. They
waited for the Holy Breath, and for
the coming of the promised power
from on high.</p>

<i>Establishment of the Christine Church.</i></span></h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_181">CHAPTER 181.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The eleven apostles make choice of
Matthias to fill the place made vacant
by the deflection of Judas.
The Christines are glad. Miriam
sings a song of praise. Apostolic
roster.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">The</span> fact that Jesus had arisen
from the dead was not denied
by many of the rulers of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> And Pilate gave an order that
the followers of the Nazarene be not
molested in their worship any place
in his domain.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> The day of Pentecost was near
at hand and every one was looking
for a manifest of Spirit power.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> Now, in Jerusalem the eleven
had met to choose a man to fill the
place of Judas who betrayed his
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
<span class="leadnum">5</span> And Peter said, The Lord
called to this ministry twelve men
as twelve foundation stones on
which the Christine temple should
be built.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> This Judas, who betrayed his
Lord, has gone to his own place beyond
the veil.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> Of him the prophet wrote: His
habitation shall be desolate; no man
shall dwell therein; his office let another
take.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> From those who have accompanied
us from Gilgal, where the
harbinger baptized, until this day,
shall one be chosen to complete the
number twelve, to fill the place from
which our brother by transgression
fell.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> And then the eleven spent a
long, long time in prayer, and when
they cast their lots, Matthias, from
the valley of the Nile, was chosen
for the place.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> Matthias was an Israelite indeed;
but he was learned in all the
wisdom of Egyptian schools, and he
had taught the mysteries of Mizraim
in Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> He was among the first to
greet the harbinger; among the first
to recognize the Nazarene as Christ,
the son of God;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> He had been with the Christine
band in all their journeys in the
land of Galilee, Judea and Samaria.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> A messenger was sent who
found Matthias, and he came and
joined the eleven, and for a time
the twelve were lost in silent prayer.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> The Christines who had come
from Galilee and places in Judea,
about six score, were there, and
Peter told them of Matthias, and
how, by lot, he had been chosen an
apostle of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> The Christines all were glad
and praised the name of God; and
Miriam sung a song of praise.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> These are the names of the
apostles of the Lord: Peter, John
and James; Philip, Andrew and
Nathaniel;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> Thomas, James the son of
Alpheus and Simon Zelotes; Matthew,
Jude, the son of Alpheus and
Matthias.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_182">CHAPTER 182.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Events of the day of Pentecost. Endowment
of the apostles. The
Christine Church is established.
Peter preaches the introductory sermon.
The sermon. Three thousand
people are baptized and become
members of the church.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when the day of Pentecost
had come Jerusalem was filled
with pious Jews and proselytes from
many lands.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">2</span> The Christines all were met
and were in perfect harmony.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">3</span> And as they sat in silent
prayer they heard a sound a-like
the distant murmur of a coming
storm.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">4</span> The sound grew loud, and
louder still, until, like thunder
peals, it filled the room where the
apostles sat.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">5</span> A brilliant light appeared, and
many thought, The building is afire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">6</span> Twelve balls, that seemed like
balls of fire, fell from heaven&mdash;a
ball from every sign of all the circle
of the heavens, and on the head of
each apostle there appeared a flaming
ball of fire.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">7</span> And every ball sent seven
tongues of fire toward heaven, and
each apostle spoke in seven dialects
of earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">8</span> The ignorant rabble treated
lightly what they heard and saw;
they said, These men are drunk,
and know not what they say.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">9</span> But men of learning were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
amazed; they said, Are not these
men who speak all Jews? how is it
that they speak in all the languages
of earth?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">10</span> And Peter said, You people
of Jerusalem, and you who live beyond
the city&#8217;s gates; Peace be to
you, and all mankind.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">11</span> This is the time that holy
men of old desired to see; by faith
they saw this hour, and now they
stand with us in ecstasy.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">12</span> The prophet Joel in the olden
times told of the things you see
and hear. The Holy Breath spoke
with his tongue and said,</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">13</span> And it shall come to pass in
latter days, that I will breathe upon
the sons of men, and fill them with
the blessedness of holiness.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">14</span> Your sons and daughters
will stand forth and prophesy; your
young men will be seers; your old
men will dream dreams.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">15</span> And I will show forth wonders
in the heavens above, and marvelous
signs in earth.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">16</span> Sounds will proceed from
heaven and voices will be heard that
men will fail to comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">17</span> The sun will fail to shine, the
moon will wade in blood before the
coming of the great day of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">18</span> And it will come to pass
that they who call upon the name
of God in faith shall be redeemed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">19</span> This is the day of Christine
power; the day that he, the man
from Galilee, is glorified.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">20</span> He came as babe in Bethlehem
and from his day of birth the
kings of earth went forth intent to
take his life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">21</span> God held him in the hollow
of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">22</span> Men called him Jesus, and
they called him well, for he was sent
to seek and save the lost.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">23</span> And Jesus grew to manhood
and was subject unto all the trials
and temptations of the sons of men,
that he might know the loads that
men must bear, and know the way
to succor them.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">24</span> In distant lands he lived and
by the sacred Word he healed the
sick, threw prison doors ajar, and
set the prisoners free, and everywhere
he was proclaimed, Immanuel.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">25</span> But wicked men despised
him and rejected him, and by
bribed men they proved him guilty
of a score of crimes;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">26</span> And in the presence of a multitude
of men who hear me now,
they nailed him to a cross;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">27</span> They sealed him with the
seal of death; but death was all too
weak to hold him in the tomb and
when immortal masters said, Adon
mashich cumi, he burst the bands
of death, and rose again to life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">28</span> He showed himself alive, not
only to the rulers in Jerusalem, but
to the many in the distant parts of
earth;</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">29</span> And then, before the wondering
eyes of many who now hear
me speak, attended by a retinue
of courtiers of the angel world, he
ascended to the throne of God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">30</span> And being now exalted high,
and having breathed to full the
Holy Breath, he breathes again on
us, and thus sheds forth what you
now see and hear.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">31</span> You men of Israel, know that
God has made this man from Galilee
whom you abused and crucified,
both Lord and Christ.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">32</span> And then the people said,
What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">33</span> And Peter said, This Christine
Lord has sent us forth to open
up the gates of dawn. Through
Christ all men may enter into light
and life.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">34</span> The Christine Church stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
on the postulates that Jesus is the
love of God made manifest; that
love is savior of the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">35</span> This Christine Church is but
the kingdom of the Holy One within
the soul, made manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">36</span> This day the Christine
Church is opened up, and whosoever
will may enter in, and, by the
boundless grace of Christ, be saved.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">37</span> Again the people said, How
may we enter in that we may share
the boundless grace of Christ?</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">38</span> And Peter said, Reform and
be baptized, and turn away from
sin and lead the life deep hid with
Christ in God, and you shall enter in
and be redeemed.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">39</span> Three thousand people
turned away from sin and were baptized
and sought to lead the life
deep hid with Christ in God.</p>

<p><span class="leadnum">40</span> And in one day the Christine
Church became a mighty power;
and Christ became a mighty word
that thrilled the multitudes in many
lands.</p>
